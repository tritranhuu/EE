A
No , I just picked it .
They just called me and I 'm like -- I heard Scott Peterson and I 'm like , yeah , I know what the question 's going to be about .
Alithia
Yeah , I heard something about it .
I do n't know .
I - I do n't know if he 's - if he 's guilty or not .
What do you think ?
A
I think so .
I think he got into an argument with her and he pushed her .
And I think she fell and maybe she hit her head or something and it killed her , so he panicked .
Alithia
What about the baby ?
A
I do n't think he -- you know , I thi - I do n't know .
I don - eh , you know , because -- th - well , with the baby and stuff , you know , she was still pregnant at that time , so .
Alithia
Oh .
A
You never know .
Alithia
Yeah , because I was really -- I was n't really following it that much because I was -
A
Yeah .
Alithia
but -- -LRB- -LRB- but I 'd love to have his hair -RRB- -RRB- something just came off the ~ TV about the Scott trial .
A
Yeah .
Where are you at ?
Alithia
I 'm in South Carolina .
A
Oh , okay .
Yeah .
I live in Redwood City , which they actually moved the trial here a couple months into it .
Um , from Modesto , California .
Alithia
Oh .
A
Where he had committed the murders , so .
Alithia
Okay .
A
Yeah , we 're a pretty small town , so our newspaper covers it a lot .
Still do , I 'm kind of sick of hearing about him , but -- e - hopefully this 'll be the end of it .
Alithia
Yeah .
A
Once they sentence him -LRB- -LRB- I bet -RRB- -RRB- .
Alithia
Yeah .
Hopefully , you know , if he 's guilty hopefully , you know , they find him guilty -- and hopefully they have evidence , you know .
Do you know if they have , like , evidence and ,
A
Yeah .
Alithia
you know , against him or whatever ?
A
There was so much evidence , you know , it 's -- a lot of it could n't be used , a lot of it was used in that , you know , what they used against him .
Alithia
How would -- did they , like , found , like , eh , you know , fingerprints or whatever ?
A
Um , no .
Um , they brought the boat down , or a duplicate of the boat to , kind of , you know , get a feel for it but they had to remove it from Redwood City because people were putting flowers in it in -- memory of Laci and , you know , planting flowers around it and stuff , so it was pretty interesting .
Alithia
Oh , yeah , that 's cool .
Eh , did you all -- did you all know her , or ?
A
But I - -- What ?
Alithia
Did you all know Laci , or ?
A
Um , a friend of mine 's sister used to work in a maternity wear store and Laci Peterson , the day before she disappeared , was in her store maternity shopping .
Alithia
Oh .
A
So , yeah , it was my friend 's sister -- who lives in Modesto .
Alithia
Oh , okay .
A
Yeah , so , it kind of hit close to home with her , she 's just -- you know , because she kind of felt like she knew her and
Alithia
Right .
Yeah , I think it 's very sad , you know , just hearing about it .
A
Yeah , it 's -- it 's -- a whole long process .
They 've been at this for almost three years , so .
Alithia
Three years ?
A
Yeah , it 's almost been three years .
Alithia
Oh , I thought it was just getting on ~ TV over here .
A
No .
Yeah , it might be over there , but it 's been on here for a long time .
Alithia
So , it must 've just went local and then then went national
A
Alithia
Oh .
A
You know , we 're close to the trial so of course it 's going to be in the newspaper every single day .
So , it 's , you know , and the trial , the , um , what is it called , the verdict , was actually read by audio over the ~ TV .
So it it 's pretty -LRB- -LRB- depressing -RRB- -RRB-
