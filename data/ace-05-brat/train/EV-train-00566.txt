BTK why is it so difficult to get him ?
Watching Larry King last night about the BTK killer and something just seems off about the whole thing .
I do n't understand -- were n't prints taken , etc ?
they have witnesses and I feel they have a whole lot more stuff .
What about prints , DNM taken off of current envelopes , etc. , he sent ?
I ~ know ~ and realize how difficult it is to get these serial killers , but still .
An author plugging his book on LK claims and with a good bit of blow that the investigation was/is as big as Kennedy 's .
Really ?
I do n't know , still feel something 's off .

Re : BTK why is it so difficult to get him ?
A serial killer in Wichita , Kansas who killed at least 8 people in the '70s and '80s .
BTK stands for bind , torture , and kill .
He sent several letters to the police and the media during that time .
And now he is communicating with them again , sending tokens from his victims .
Or someone is playing a big hoax .
I 've wondered too , with all the forensic advances in the past 25 years why he has n't been identified .
Here 's a link .

Re : BTK why is it so difficult to get him ?
You do well to wonder why the BTK killer was not captured until yesterday .
The informal speculation is that the Wichita police department was not up to the task .
Consider this :
- One of the BTK killer 's victims lived on the same street as the killer
- The BTK killer once called up a police dispatcher and told her of the crime he just committed , and still they could not catch him
- the BTK killer was a known nitpicker and nuissance .
This is actually a indicator in profiles of serial killers and mastermind terrorists .
- the BTK killer was only found out when his daughter recognized certain traits and turned in her DNA , which was a close match to the DNA on file for her father .
Like in the case of the Unibomber , if it was n't for the foresight and charity of a relative , the BTK killer would still be loose .
I was once reading how a criminal was being tracked in Washington , DC , and how he escaped a police dragnet several times , once by taking a taxi .
Though there are very brave police , to a large extent the police have no incentive to capture a criminal , just to stay out of harm 's way and to collect facts after the fact .
The rich hire private security for a reason -- public security is often inadequate .

What does BTK stand for ?
I read the article in the newspaper this morning and no where did it answer that question .
-LRB- And it 's probably so obvious I will slap the side of my head when I find out .

I believe Bind Torture Kill = BTK .
My point about taking so long ... for thirty years people did n't feel safe .
The LE has an obligation to keep safe .
I bet the neighbors are going through hell .
