Out come the long knives

Apparently Carly made a lot of journalistic enemies during her six hears at HP .
Not only was the catalyst for her fall from grace a Fortune article by Carol Loomis -LRB- who as far as I know is immortal -- she 's been writing for Fortune since 1954 -RRB- , but the anti-Carly brigades are out in full force at Salon.com .
This is getting a little harsh ; she might have messed up at HP -LRB- I refuse to call it by the new name , for now -RRB- , but she was n't actively trying to destroy a great company and wreck the shareholders .
It just , well , happened .
So , right , Carly was a bad manager , and she eventually got what she deserved , but she is n't evil incarnate .
