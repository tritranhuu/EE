`` the fact that he did not intend to drive was irrelevant ''
FFS !
If that 's not relevant , then what the fluck * is * ?
Oh well , lets cross now to our mob of mindless drones and hear about how good it is that this menace to society is going to be locked up before he kills all our innocent children .

No doubt been the law in Q since it was extended from being drunk in charge of a horse .
It 's also been rigorously policed for as long as I can remember .
Note also that had the drunken fool attempted to sleep it off out of the car he 'd have been carted off to clink for a different offence .
Had he been seen consuming alcohol in public he 'd have been done for that as well .
As every Queenslander knows ... if we did n't have the toughest laws outside Islam the place would be rolling with drunks !

This is getting beyond a joke , several times I have slept in my car after a night out , to drive home or be picked up the next day depending on alcahol consumption .
FFS just because he sat is the drivers seat does not mean he took control of the car .
What about if he put the keys in the ignition to turn to accessories to listen to the radio ?
It the car was running fair enough , I wonder why the law is doubted so often

I thought this law was fairly well known , as long as you do n't have the keys on you are ok .
Surely everyone has heard the trick of rolling the front wheel over the keys .
Chances are sleeping it off in the car wo n't be terribly effective because you 'll most likely be over 0.05 the next morning anyway .

In Q he 's in charge of the car from the moment he attempts to put the key in the door lock .
If he 's asleep in the back seat with the keys in his possession then he 's the person in charge of the car .
The offence is being drunk in charge of a vehicle -- as distinct from being drunk while operating a vehicle -LRB- which is a separate offence -RRB- .
The way to avoid being charged is to give the keys to someone else to unlock the door and have them hang on to the keys until you 're below .05 .
The standard ruse is to throw the keys under the car after you 've unlocked the door -LRB- which you can later claim was unlocked by a person unknown -RRB- .
In this case the offender escaped conviction first time around because it was accepted that he attempted to get rid of the keys , which supposedly landed in his lap .
Judge McGill got it right as the law stands .

Just trying to understand here ... given this quote : ''
.
Does that mean if I 'm at home alone getting pissed with the car keys on the coffee table and the car parked outside , that I 'm `` in a position to drive the vehicle if I choose to do so without first taking charge of it from some other person '' and can therefore be charged ?
Sure , no reasonable cop would do that , but just strictly talking from the law side of things .
Or does the fact that I 'm on private property change that ?
Or what if I were in a bar with the car outside , keys in my pocket , but I 've decided I 'll take the train home later ?
It would be a pretty sad state of the laws if they could come in , ask for the owner of car rego `` XXX-999 '' and breathalise me because I had the keys in my pocket .

If he had a pistol in his pocket , or a case of gelignite at his feet , I 'd guess that half the people on this ng would be baying for his hide ... Where 's the fundamental difference ?
Same as if the pistol is in the safe and the gelly is locked in the shed .
So long as you do n't attempt to access either any charge is n't likely to stick .
I 'm reminded of when I lived in another state and the local cop charged the town drunk in his driveway after following him home from the pub .
The drunk was acquitted on the technicality that he was n't on a public road when the cop arrested him .
Would n't have happened under Qld law -- and should n't have happened anywhere else .
So whose law is stupid ?
Agreed , and not likely to happen in Q. You 're deemed to be in charge of the vehicle from the moment you attempt to put the key in the door lock .
Sounds fair enough to me -- especially since most Queenslanders are well aware of the law .
