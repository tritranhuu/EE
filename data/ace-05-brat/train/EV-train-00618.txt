I own a restaurant .

Seventeen people employed there .

They 're uh -- well , actually , you know they 're some of my cake decorators in the bakery area too .
They 're it 's it 's predominantly a Hispanic run organization .
I 'm not Hispanic , but they uh I 've hired uh
Roger
Yeah .
Diane
a couple that worked out quite well , and then I 've let them -- recommend family members and friends , and that seems to have been a really -- good setup , because they 're -- recommending people that they know work well , and -- you know , it 's it 's uh and they 're happy with who they 're working with .
And I 've sort of left some of that up to them .
I 've got a a manager that -- you know , she 's -- I defer to her on who thinks whether she thinks I should hire somebody or not .
And I 've had really good luck , because the restaurant business typically um
Roger
Yeah .
Diane
does not keep people very long .
It 's a short term employment , and I 've got people that 's been with me for eight , nine , ten years now .
You know , long term employees , so
Roger
Yeah .
Diane
it 's -- it 's been a good setup .
Um -- you know , I 've got the older ones typically are the ones that run the different departments , you know the the -- deli area or the bakery area or the up front area , and -- the new ones kind of defer to them , and -- it sort of runs itself .
I feel really lucky .
I 've got a I 've got a really good crew .
Roger
Yeah .
Diane

Roger
That 's what you need .
Diane
And she 's uh -- hard worker , always there , um -- everybody -- She works with everybody rather than just telling them what to do , and they respect her and work for her quite well , so -- I 'm not working nearly as hard as I was a few years back .
