Holiday Traditions : The holiday season is right around the corner .
Who do you like to celebrate with during the holidays ?
Do you go to a lot of parties with friends , neighbors , co-workers or family members ?
Are there people you see during the holidays that you do n't see during the rest of the year ?
Do you travel to meet up with family or friends during the holidays ?
Where do you go and who do you visit ?
Ed
Hi this is Ed .
good .
how are you doing Jane ?
if you hear noise in the background , I 'm enjoying the holiday season walking in New York City , so
Jane
Oh , okay .
Ed
-LRB- -LRB- city -RRB- -RRB- -- -LRB- -LRB- trusts of life -RRB- -RRB- -- crazy people and , uh , other things going on but that 's New York , what can you say .
Jane
Yeah yeah yeah .
Used to live in New York .
My brother-in-law still lives in the city but we were Long Island people .
Ed
Yeah .
Uh , so what are you doing for the festive holidays .
Jane
You know , it 's really bad because I still really do n't know .
I 'm up in the air with about six different clients trying to decide what we 're going to do .
Ed
-LRB- -LRB- Allan -RRB- -RRB- -- Well , that 's not bad .
That means that you 've got a lot of people to see and do things with .
That 's good .
Jane
Yeah , makes it kind of hectic .
How about you ?
What are you doing ?
Ed
Ah , family .
Jane
Ach .
Ed
Yeah .
Yeah , we 're going to be doing , uh , the typical .
Go up and celebrate with the family and -- be with the little kids .
You know , the -LRB- -LRB- tough years -RRB- -RRB- and that which makes it -- because when you get older it 's kind of , I 've got all the gifts , I do n't need that .
What I really want to do is see somebody else enjoy it and the little kids enjoy it .
So - -- and , uh , do a lot of parties with family -- and friends .
Jane
Well , that 's kind of where - we 're in between which family we 're going to see and when and how and get all that worked out .
Ed
Uh ,
Jane
Ed
so whoev - yeah , I 've seen them - -- just not the gifts it comes down to the food .
See , now you -LRB- -LRB- -RRB- -RRB- .
Jane
There you go .
I - one of these choices is meat cooking .
We 'll have to put that towards the end .
Ed
-LRB- -LRB- Ah , oui .
-RRB- -RRB- -- Eh , -LRB- -LRB- nice -RRB- -RRB- .
So we - we 've only -
Jane
Ed
my family 's , uh , parents are deceased and most of -LRB- -LRB- them -RRB- -RRB- is , uh , passed my brothers all over , so her family 's still younger -- and , uh , you know , just the odd sides .
She 's the oldest and I 'm the youngest , so she 's got younger which -- keeps the thing going , so I - -- you know , my view is -- -LRB- -LRB- stay -RRB- -RRB- with the family go visit the family .
That 's all you got .
So -- keep it together through thick and thin and -- when it comes to Thanksgiving we go up there and we celebrate .
And then there 's little parties .
Big - uh , her sister does a big family party -- but try to keep that same
Jane
Ed
local family coming together .
It 's amazing how they can get into little squabbles and who does n't show up
Jane
Of course .
Ed
like that .
I think it 's crazy .
So , -LRB- -LRB- so , uh -RRB- -RRB- -
Jane
They used to always really all get together .
but his parents uh they actually live next door to us .
but they 're starting to get up in the years , so they 're not , you know , hosting the big parties , so it 's funny how now people do n't all bother to come
Ed
Yeah .
Jane
and you kind of wonder you know in the next couple of years what 's all going to happen .
Are they all going to see each other .
Ed
Yeah , no that 's - that 's exactly .
I 've already seen , you know , -LRB- -LRB- in -RRB- -RRB- my parents -LRB- -LRB- ' bed -RRB- -RRB- until they -LRB- -LRB- got -RRB- -RRB- less and less that the brothers got together -- and then now when there 's an event you try to do it .
At Christmas it 's just impossible because we leave -- two days after Christmas
Jane
Mhm .
Ed
to go out of the country as part of our New Year 's
Jane
Ed
celebration .
So , for us it 's , you know , got to be a quick trip up
Jane
Ed
to her family and then back where we - -- we 've been invited to be down in
Jane
Ed
another country .
If a person is not - even though it 's cold up in the Northeast , it 's a family tradition .
I should do it -- and less for the gifts and more for
Jane
Ed
being together .
Yeah .
Jane
Well , we did - -- - for the kids you know we made it pretty cl -
Ed
I do n't know , I think that 's great .
Jane
- you know , you did n't have all the hassle of running around and being crazy and just kind of spent time together
Ed
And I think that 's very - I mean , if -
Jane
and it was really pretty nice .
Ed
Yeah , we have n't - -- yeah , I think -- e - e - eventually that may happen , the way we 're going with , uh ,
Jane
Ed
my wife and I with her
Jane
Ed
family .
Not as a negative but as a -
Jane
Ed
you know , we do a lot of traveling so that 's going to be - I think that 's going to come up .
Jane
Ed
But - -- but for now we 're still trying to do -
Jane
Ed
as long as the mother 's around , we 'll still do Christmas and act as -
Jane
Ed
she is not really old , but she 's getting older , so I think that 's one reason to stay together
Jane
Ed
and also I think i - is
Jane
Ed
eh , we - we kind of -- infused a little family party that her sister has so -- I think if we were to go away both of those might fall off a little bit and it does n't take but one year and then all of the sudden everybody 's
Jane
Yeah .
Ed
not coming to it anymore and it 's like a -
Jane
That 's it .
That 's the way it is .
Ed
Yeah , but not because -
Jane
If I 'm no -
Ed
it is - -- I - I enjoy the -- smiling people and the festive - -- festive nature and -- I think it does get a little commercialized .
-LRB- -LRB- It 's not that the - -RRB- -RRB- -- You can ignore that part of it , I guess .
