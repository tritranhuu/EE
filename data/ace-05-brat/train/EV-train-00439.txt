Look at Latest Evidence Against Iraq ; Any Hope U.N. , Old Europe will Come Around to Bush Administration 's Way of Thinking ?
CHRISTINA WRIGHT
My name is Christina Wright -LRB- ph -RRB- .
I 'm from Minneapolis , Minnesota .
And I was just curious if you feel that the attack on Iraq would actually open a Pandora 's box in other Middle Eastern countries that we are known to aid and harbor terrorists , such as Syria and Iran .
CARLSON
It might .
I mean that 's absolutely one of the fears .
That it would destabilize the entire region .
On the other hand , the region is pretty unstable , filled with people who already hate Americans and seek to do America harm .
So the question is , could it be worse ?
BEGALA
Our president believes it will set off a positive domino effect of democracy through the region .
Maybe he 's right .
I do n't think he 's thought it through .
I think it 's more likely that this very unstable region could cause even more problems .
-LRB- CROSSTALK -RRB-
CARLSON
Oh , come on .
That 's silly .
FABIAN
Hi .
I 'm Fabian from Bonn , Germany .
And my question is , after today 's meeting in Paris , where France , Russia and Germany decided to not back a second resolution , who is not -LRB- UNINTELLIGIBLE -RRB- ?
Is it the U.S. or is it old Europe ?
CARLSON
It 's actually Western Europe , because 18 European countries are on the side of the United States .
So France and Germany -- that 's actually true -- find themselves in the minority on their own continent .
And good .
BEGALA
Only Great Britain is with us .
The only country ...
CARLSON
What do you mean only Great Britain ?
BEGALA
My question is not who votes at the U.N. Who sends troops to die on our side ?
Nobody except Great Britain .
We are isolated .
From the left , I am Paul Begala .
Goodnight for CROSSFIRE .
CARLSON
From the right , I 'm Tucker Carlson .
Join us again tomorrow night for yet more CROSSFIRE .
