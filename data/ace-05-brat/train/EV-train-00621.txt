we are watching activity in baghdad .
while we do , we want to tell you marines battling for control of the bridges in the southern city of nasiriyah face stiff resistance from iraqi paramilitary groups today .
for some perspective , let 's turn to miles o'brien with retired air force general don shepperd .
thank you very much .
if you are going to fight on the ground , you have to encounter bridges somewhere along the way .
a lot of bridges between where the 3 7 cavalry and the rest of the u.s. forces are now and their ultimate destination , downtown baghdad .
we have the city laid out for you here .
how many bridges in this city alone ?
in this map we have right here , 13 major bridges in downtown baghdad , including the expressway bridge over here .
three bridges here attaching east baghdad to west baghdad and the palace area .
this is one technique , one possible way u.s. forces might seize a bridge , a bridge that might be defended by iraqis .
let 's look at the animation .
typical scenario there .
it does n't really matter for this scenario that we 're laying out here .
this would be representing m1-a1 tanks coming towards the bridge firing .
you have to bundle up and line up to go across that bridge .
makes it vulnerable to fire from the other side .
potentially chemical weapons , too .
as we turn the other direction , what you 'll see are these iraqi tanks that are kind of fortified there .
they have burns in front of them .
artillery behind them firing back .
and then they there goes the smoke screen .
the idea of the smoke screen is to obscure the oncoming forces fire ing at you from being able to see .
it does n't work , though .
it works both ways .
it obscures you but also obscures them .
here 's an f-16 .
he comes in and wants to identify his target and he 's got a big --
ca n't see through the smoke .
we 've got some techniques we 're going to show you .
somewhere near we can put down special
