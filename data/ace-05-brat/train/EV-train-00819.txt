Feminists have a reason to celebrate today as an appeals court just threw out the convictions of their martyr , Andrea Yates , by ruling that one of the prosecutor 's expert witnesses gave false testimony at her trial .
Yates , in case you have forgotten , is the women from Texas who heinously drowned her five kids , aged 6 months to 7 years , one by one , in her bathtub .
Liberal feminist organizations rushed to Yates ' defense , most notably the National Organization for Women , which provided money for her defense fund and held candlelight vigils .
No such ceremonies were held for her five dead children .
In 2002 a jury sentenced Yates to life in prison for the deaths of three of her children .
She was not tried in the deaths of the other two .
Today the 1st Court of Appeals overturned the convictions and ordered a new trial .
We can only hope for the same verdict .
