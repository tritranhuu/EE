Well , after many trying months of defending Saddam Hussein , Ambassador Mohammed Aldouri finally said the game is over .
Now , his tenure at the United Nations is over , too .
Last night before leaving the United States , Aldouri said he hopes to see free elections in a free Iraq .
CNN 's Richard Roth has more on this once prominent frontman for the Iraqi regime .

RICHARD ROTH , CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB-
The last time Iraqi 's U.N. ambassador addressed the Security Council , the U.S. ambassador walked out in protest .
MOHAMMED ALDOURI , IRAQI AMBASSADOR TO U.N. -LRB- through translator -RRB-
What happened is that the Iraqi army up until now has not confronted the United States forces .
ROTH
But now , it 's the Iraqi ambassador 's time to leave , the United States .
ALDOURI
The game is over .
I hope that peace will prevail , and that the Iraqi people at the end of the day will have a peaceful life .
ROTH
Mohammed Aldouri spent more years as a university professor than as a diplomat .
In New York , he briefed people interested in his country , recently a group of Lehigh University students .
But he never got comfortable in the media glare before and especially during the war .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE
You said you were n't ...
ALDOURI
-LRB- UNINTELLIGIBLE -RRB- has happened with you ?
Please , why did you come here ?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE
Because we thought ...
ALDOURI
Tomorrow , I will see you in the U.N.
ROTH
And at the U.N. , all ambassadors carry out their instructions whether they agree with them or not .
JUAN GABRIEL VALDES , CHILEAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S.
Well , I think that he had a very , very difficult task .
He defended the positions of his country with courage , I would say .
JEREMY GREENSTOCK , BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO U.N.
He 's a decent man , and I hope he finds a decent life representing a decent government .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE
Aldouri is a dear friend of mine .
ROTH
Aldouri also drew support from opponents of the war a gift of paper cranes .
But on the eve of Aldouri 's departure , women representing the Daughters of the American Revolution passed by , wanting to let fly with something else .
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE
If I had eggs , I would like to throw eggs at him .
ROTH
U.N. diplomats do n't toss eggs , just nods .
Several months ago , the U.S. ambassador , John Negroponte , and the Iraqi ambassador almost locked eyes .
And forget about Kuwait .
MOHAMMED ABULHASAN , KUWAITI AMBASSADOR TO U.N.
Nothing .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE
Not one word ?
ABULHASAN
Not one word , except a normal greeting of , `` Hello , how are you ?
''
ROTH
That was as close as residents of New York 's Upper East Side district got to know Aldouri , who kept a low profile , like many in the big city .
It 's a neighborhood you would n't expect the diplomatic post of an enemy government to turn up .
ALDOURI
I am very thankful for the people of New York , for their generosity .
This is a very decent people .
I was really -- without talking about the problem in Iraq , I was really happy to be here in New York , within the people of New York .
ROTH
Aldouri was worried most about the people of Iraq .
ALDOURI
When I see , what I 've seen , what you see , my heart squeezes blood .
ROTH
Aldouri was in better spirits as he departed for the airport with a final message .
ALDOURI
I hope that the United States Army will leave Iraq soon , and we will have free election for a free government for a free future for Iraq and the people for Iraq .
This is my message to you , to the people of the United States .
ROTH
The ambassador 's prime concern now : his family in Iraq .
One day he hopes to teach again back home .

We 'll try to track his progress and see if he 's able to do that , Ambassador Aldouri .
Still ahead , looters cast about for new places to loot , and chaos is king in Baghdad .
We 'll have a report .
