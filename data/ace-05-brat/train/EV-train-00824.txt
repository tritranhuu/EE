Apparently Yuganskneftegaz , which was sold to an independent buyer who turned out to be an apparatus of the state -LRB- yes , the same state that 1 -RRB- forced Yukos to do the auction , and 2 -RRB- ran the auction , not that 3 -RRB- this is suspicious or anything -RRB- , and which was then being bought with foreign assistance , is not being bought with foreign assistance .
As of this morning , at least .
Anyway , it looks like they 're denying Chinese involvement to avoid a lawsuit , which is funny -- you 'd think they might know someone in the Russian judiciary who could help them out .
