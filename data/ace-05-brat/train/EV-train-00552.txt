Singapore extends use of SARS thermal scanners to include checkpoints with Malaysia
SINGAPORE -LRB- AP -RRB-
Singapore authorities extended the use of its state-of-the-art thermal imaging scanner to fight the deadly SARS virus by placing units at its border with Malaysia .
The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said it began a trial of the scanners Wednesday at its Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints to screen for people suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome .
Nine scanners , developed locally for military purposes , were placed at Singapore 's Changi Airport last week to check people arriving from SARS-affected countries .
Those who show up on the camera screen as `` hot bodies , '' or with a temperature greater than 37.5 degrees Celsius -LRB- 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- , will be pulled aside .
Each day about 90,000 people cross the border between Malaysia and Singapore .
Any person found to be entering Singapore with a high temperature would be directed to a nearby nurse station for further checks .
Singapore has reported 16 deaths , the world 's third-highest toll , out of 186 infected from the flu-like illness .
Globally , at least 236 people have died and more than 4,000 have become sickened with the illness .
Immigration and Checkpoints Authority spokeswoman Ngoon Pei Ling said during the trial period the scanners would be placed at bus checkpoints , where passengers are already required to disembark for immigration purposes .
