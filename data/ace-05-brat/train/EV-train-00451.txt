Christina
Hi .
Greg
Hi .
Christina
I 'm Christina from Connecticut .
Greg
I 'm Greg from Columbus , Ohio .
Christina
Oh , okay .
Ooh , Scott Peterson .
I was like , I got to talk to someone about this .
I have to voice my opinion .
Well , no , I mean you could go or , well
Greg
Uh , I -- Okay , go ahead .
Hey shoot , you got more sense than I do .
Christina
Okay , I -- have been following the trial , I do n't know why , ever since this whole thing happened .
I am a stay at home mom , so I get to watch the ~ TV more often , and I -- you know have been fo - -- watching all these forensic pathologists , Dr. Henry Lee .
You know , and and what I see is that there is no physical evidence that he did it .
And yeah , it sounds like he did do it because he dyed his hair , was trying to get away , and the anchor and a boat .
But there 's -- -- I for some reason , deep down in my heart , do n't believe he did it .
And you know and I think the media made him guilty , and I think -- it 's like you know , I mean you saw what happened outside the courtroom , I do n't know if you did or not , see how they were cheering on .
I do n't think he 's guilty and , I hope he does n't get the death penalty .
And -- I do n't know .
I I just do n't think he 's guilty .
I think he 's wrong , what he did , everything , he cheated on his wife , that 's so wrong , but -- that does n't make him a murderer , he 's just a cheater , he 's just a -- you know , like one hundred ten percent you know eighteen karat -- asshole , like i - Mar - Mark Geragos called him .
Greg
Yeah .
Christina
How about you ?
You probably think he 's guilty , or
Greg
Well -- Yeah , no I , I think , I think -LRB- -LRB- the guy 's -RRB- -RRB- definitely guilty uh Just based on , I have n't followed it all that closely , although you ca n't help but follow it closely because there 's so much crap on the news .
Christina
Mhm .
Greg
But uh no i - the -- uh the I think well first of all , you know I agree with you , I think cheating on your wife 's pretty low .
But I think what happened i - it 's living the b - uh living large .
You could tell both of them uh you look some of the things they had , you know , he had a few bucks or so .
-LRB- -LRB- -RRB- -RRB- finish , things were getting him down , uh you know , you know how it is , day after day though -- M - marriage is n't all that wonderful .
Christina
Right .
Greg
Eh , you know and I do n't think he had faced that , and plus , you know , a lot of the neat stuff from the outside , and particularly Amber Frey , who I do n't particularly think is neat , but it was something that uh you know he went after
Christina
Mhm .
Greg
and so uh he figured , well -- these will , these things would get rid of her I guess .
I do n't , I do n't know why like his uh , the wife 's or the mother said divorce is an option I think .
Christina
Yeah .
I know , that 's very powerful .
Not , you know , not murder and , oh , I mean , I do n't know .
Greg
But -- you know , I I can see , the guy was n't thinking right .
He was screwed up , you know , a despicable human being and he , just -- You know , the easy way out .
This 'll work , I guarantee I 'm too damn smart .
Christina
But you know what , it 's like I think they did n't want to find him guilty because remember when ~ OJ was not found guilty ?
I mean , oh my God , the , you know , but it 's like , ~ LA would have like , turned ~ LA upside down , like all the , you know
Greg
Yeah .
Christina
I - it just , I do n't know what would happen if he was found guilty , but now I think they said that they wanted to prove that -- you know , okay , we 're not going to let this guy walk , like , do n't let this guy walk either , big high profile case .
Greg
Well , yeah you have to look , see , I think the locale , that both of them took place , and one took place in ~ LA , which is terribly open - minded and , uh , the other one took place in uh , Mida - well , uh -LRB- -LRB- Redoak -RRB- -RRB- City .
Christina
Mhm .
Redwood City , yeah .
Greg
And who , Redwood City is one of those things that would , uh shift San Francisco and ~ LA to , uh , to a red state rather than a blue state if you let them .
It 's very , very conservative there .
