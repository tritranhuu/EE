Blockbuster/Hollywood -- A debt-based hostile takeover ?

I 've been keeping a careful eye on the Blockbuster / Hollywood machinations for a while -LRB- and well I should -- I have stock in one of the deal 's participants , Movie Gallery -RRB- , but even so I 'm surprised that Blockbuster 's latest gambit is to buy up Hollywood 's debt .
It 's an admirable hedge -- if Movie Gallery wins , it could improve Hollywood 's rating , and either way it offers Blockbuster some leverage .
And this is , as far as I know , the first time since the Allegheny deal that there 's been a hostile takeover using debt .
