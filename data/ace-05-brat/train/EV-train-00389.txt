Saddam posed a threat to Saudia , Kuwait , and the British oil protectorates along the Gulf - that is why we invaded , stupid .

The truth seems to me that the Israeli government got panicked when Saddam announced that he would reward the families of Palestinian suicide bombers with some 10 thousand dollars .

ROFL .
How old are you ?
Too young to remember the scuds Saddam 's Iraqi Republican Guards lobbed into Israel in 1991 , or 1982 when the Israelis levelled the Iraqi nuclear weapon facility ?

Re : THOUSANDS DIED TO PROTECT ISRAEL !
Do n't even bother asking if this guy remembers the Iraq/Iran war of 1980-1988 , which when Saddam launched a land / air invasion of Iran .
Anyone remember Khomeini 's declaration in 1982 that Iran would n't stop fighting until they overthrew Saddam ?
How about Saddam 's use of chemical weapons ?
Recall that we -LRB- and the Brits -RRB- involved ourselves in that war ONLY in 1987 , after attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers .
How many Iraqis and Iranians were killed in that war ?
One million ?
Two million ?
Saddam was so unimpressed by Iraqi casualties , he invaded Kuwait barely two years after the UN-imposed ceasefire .
This clown , however , thinks `` the truth '' is that it was Israel who got panicked .
Yeah , right .
