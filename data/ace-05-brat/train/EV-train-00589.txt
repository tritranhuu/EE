New Explosions in Mosul , Baghdad
TUCHMAN
This is a very busy base .
We want to give you a look right now at the aircraft coming in for landings .
It looks like LAX on a Sunday night and this is what it 's been like for the past 11 days .
We have just watched multitudes of warplanes land , multitudes of warplanes take off and this may be the busiest night of the campaign .
They 're expecting a total at this particular base near the Iraqi border of 300 sorties in a 24-hour period ending today according to the Air Force total from all the bases and there are more than 30 bases in 12 different countries in the Middle East according to the Pentagon .
They 're saying there will be 1500 sorties in a 24-hour period ending tomorrow .
Eight hundred of those sorties will be strike sorties using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down in the amount of air power being used over Iraq .
Wolf , back to you .
BLITZER
That 's a lot of bombs and missiles .
Gary Tuchman in an air base near the Iraq border , thanks very much , Gary Tuchman .

Well , as coalition forces push north , they are encountering a unique problem of combat , getting rid of the weapons captured from the enemy .
Some of the 40,000 British troops are kicking up a lot of dust in the Iraqi desert making sure that nothing is left behind them that could hurt them .
Greg Milam is with the U.K. forces in southern Iraq .

GREG MILAM , CNN CORRESPONDENT
Seemingly deserted , these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to British forces in Iraq .
SERGEANT GEOFF BANHAM , ROYAL ENGINEERS
This is what we 're coming across a lot of these , 30 mil , 60 mil , 80 mil , even 120 mil .
So there 's plenty still out there that will have to be recovered because they can be used .
MILAM
Do you know when this place was last used ?
I mean do you know -LRB- UNINTELLIGIBLE -RRB-
BANHAM
I 'm not too sure but judging by some of this , it 's been here quite a long time so whether it 's been used recently by them - there was an Intel upbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this to use against them .
MILAM
Grenades , mortars , all sorts of ammunition abandoned by Iraqi soldiers but there for the taking .
The job of these Royal Engineers is to clear this and many other mountains of armaments and destroy them .
Some are too unstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot .
The rest is carried way out into the desert .
And today 's parts in this conflict , this kind of work becomes more and more important .
With the coalition forces moving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurking behind them .
CAPTAIN ANDY GOOCH , ROYAL ENGINEERS
With the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about , if they 'd used those systems , that amount of weapon it would have given us a considerable amount of trouble trying to take the positions .
MILAM
With much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do .
No one in the British forces here is willing to take any risks .
