New Questions About Attacking Iraq ; Is Torturing Terrorists Necessary ?
NOVAK
OK .
Question from the audience .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE
Hi .
I 'm Paul Avalar -LRB- ph -RRB- from Tempe , Arizona .
I had a question also about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed .
And now how are people going to argue that the U.S. can no longer both fight a war with Iraq and also fight terrorism , specifically al Qaeda ?
NOVAK
That 's a great question .
It 's an unanswerable point .
He has n't been able to answer it .
And Tom Andrews -LRB- ph -RRB- was n't able to answer it .
BEGALA
Look , we need allies to catch these guys .
We got him because the Pakistanis got him .
We did n't get him .
We go to war in Iraq , 200,000 people start protesting in Pakistan , they put too much pressure on the government .
It becomes impossible for those governments to cooperate with us like they 're cooperating now .
We go to war in Iraq , it would be the worst thing we can do ...
NOVAK
You know the one thing the Democrats ca n't stand is good news .
It is just something you can not handle .
BEGALA
No .
What I ca n't stand is a president who is going to screw up our war against terrorism when I thought that was his job .
From the left , I 'm Paul Begala .
Good night for CROSSFIRE .
NOVAK
From the right , I 'm Robert Novak .
Join us again next time for another edition of CROSSFIRE .
