I get -- regardless of what year it is or who the candidates are I get tired of listening to it .
It -- basically all of it 's the same thing all the time and , uh ,
John
Uh-huh .
Ivan
they , uh , tell you the same thing and then they turn around and -- do something different all the time anyway , so it 's -- I do n't know if it 's , uh , I guess it 's wor - -- worth voting , but -- sometimes I wonder .

Right .
Was n't , uh , Wisconsin was like a swing , er , uh , they were really pu - or no it was Ohio , I think , was the really , uh ,

Hopefully it 's -- good choice , you know ,
Ivan
Mhm .
John
I do n't know .
Ivan
Wow , you really -
John
I di - I did n't have a lot of faith in any of them , really ,
Ivan

John

Ivan
No , they 're , ah , I ca n't ever remember a perfect choice and I 've been voting since , uh , Nixon McGovern , uh , so
John
Right .
Ivan
I , uh , I 'd - I 've never -- ever seen a perfect candidate .
John

Ivan
But that 's
John
Yeah .
Ivan
th - that 's to be expected , I mean , you know , they 're all human beings .
John
Ca n't please everybody .
Ivan
Yeah .
Yep .
And , uh , as far as what I thought of the various candidates , uh , you know , I guess we -- said what we said about Bush , but , uh , Kerry , I do n't know , it 's just that -- - coast , uh , kind of persona or image , - t , uh , I -- do n't care for , for one thing .
John
Uh-huh .
Ivan
From Massachusetts i - -- - candidate .
John
Right .
Ivan
And , uh , Cheney -- which he 's kind of out your way , uh , Wyoming .
John
Uh-huh .
Ivan
Uh , uh , he 's kind of a non-descript person , as far as , like I I 'm sure he 's he 's probably a nice guy , and -- a lot of fun at a party probably , I do n't know , but , you know , just from -- what you see of him , he 's just kind of -- kind of like an old grandpa , you know .
John
Yeah , he 's real grouchy .
Ivan
Yeah , he just
John
In those debates he was like a pitbull .
Ivan
Yeah , yeah .
John
You know , he would c - him and , uh , I mean , uh , I do n't know , he he kind of picked apart Edwards
Ivan
Mhm .
John
and , um , but then -- Edwards fought back kind of -- you know and then all the stuff you hear about Edwards too , about the , uh , how he 's a trial lawyer and how he made all his millions -- suing insurance companies and , um , you know , there - there 's -- bad stuff you hear about both of them that , you know , obviously they want to tell you
Ivan
Yeah .
Yeah .
John
that I did n't like .
And , I guess I did n't really like that , uh , uh , Kerry was , like , changing his story all the time , like , oh , I - -- I believe in this but , uh , no I do n't but yes I do and ,
Ivan
Yeah .
John
you know .
I 'm kind of a cut and dry kind of a guy .
Ivan
Yeah .
John
If you got an opinion I 'd rather just want you to tell me straight up and not
Ivan
Yeah .
John
try to beat around the bush to -- get my vote or something like that .
Ivan
Yeah , yeah .
Yeah , I guess to a certain degree they -- they , uh , I guess try to play to the middle and try to -- please as many people as they can but Kerry was just all over the map .
John
Right .
