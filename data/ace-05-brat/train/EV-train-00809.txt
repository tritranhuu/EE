Board Member Compensation
Hello all ,
What is the recommended policy on compensating board members for attending meetings , when they have no vacation time left at work , and are attending the board meeting on their own time , without pay .
We do n't want to lose the contributions of this board member , but this has become a financial issue .
Thanks .

If your organization is a charity , it is generally considered to be inappropriate , and in some jurisdictions , it is illegal to compensate board members for their service .
You should check out the law in your state and/or country .
It is reasonable , however , to reimburse board members for legitimate and necessary expenses incurred in order to serve on the board .
I wonder if you could make a case for paying someone to replace the board member so the board member can attend meetings .
I 'm not a lawyer , but it seems to me to be similar to reimbursing a board member for a babysitter , which no one questions .
Another possibility is to change the meeting times .

Re : Board Member Compensation
We are incorporated in Maryland .
There are just 5 of us on the board -LRB- we are a charity 501 -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- , although we all live in different states from coast to coast .
It is very difficult to find times for all of us to get together .
Would I need to check the Maryland law or the law in the state in which this board member lives ?
Thanks .

Re : Board Member Compensation
In IRS Publication 557 , the sample draft articles of incorporation indicate that NO compensation may be paid to directors .
In fairness , reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses on behalf of the organization -- including travel and lodging to attend board meetings -- are allowed .
However , Publication 557 does not explicitly prohibit compensation to directors .
As far as state laws go , you must follow the laws for the states -LRB- 1 -RRB- in which the organization is incorporated and -LRB- 2 -RRB- in which the organization operates .
For an organization that is incorporated in Maryland and has its headquarters in Maryland , the laws of Maryland apply without regard to the states in which the directors live .
Remember , a corporation is legally a `` person '' , distinct from the corporeal persons who govern , manage , and operate the corporation .
Thus , the laws applying to the corporate person are the laws of the state where that person `` lives '' .

Re : Board Member Compensation
It is very legal , and an acceptable policy or practice in Canada to pay an honorarium or stipent for people on boards that are active .
Many do this , as they know it is an investment for the time and talents they need .
They also know , as do the recipients , the payment is but a percentage of the true worth of the time and effort , but does show respect for what they are recieving .

Re : Board Member Compensation
Is there anyone who knows of a precedent for this being done for a non-profit in the U.S. ?
Thanks !

Re : Board Member Compensation
Yes .
Some Head Start agencies , Community Health Centers , and similar nonprofit organizations serving low-income people have a requirement for `` consumer '' representation on their boards .
Transportation cost reimbursement , child care accommodation , provision of meals , etc. , can be done either in-kind or in cash .

Re : Board Member Compensation
Actually , it would not be advisable to accept Freddy 's comments at face value .
It is not acceptable policy and not legal to pay an honorarium or stipend to directors of charities .
I checked with a lawyer familiar with Canadian charity law , who explained that it is not permitted to remunerate board members of charities for their service as board members .
The prohibition does not apply to directors of nonprofit organizations that are not charities .
In the USA , the rules vary from state to state .
Some states permit board members of charities to be compensated , but it is generally not done .
Donors , funders , and the general public share the view that directors of charities should act gratuitiously .
It is permitted everywhere , however , to reimburse directors for necessary expenses incurred in order to serve .
If your organization is a charity , you need to check your state law and act very carefully if you are considering paying board members .

Re : Board Member Compensation
Being someone that works and lives in Canada , and in the non-profit industry , it is done , and it is very legal .
Take a look at any of the large student unions , they all pay their elected board members an honorarium , as do many of the large foundations .
It is legal , and it is done .
