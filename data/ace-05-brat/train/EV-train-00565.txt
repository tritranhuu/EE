From the Associated Press : The Supreme Court declined Monday to consider whether states may offer license plates with anti-abortion messages , leaving lower courts divided over whether the programs in a dozen states unconstitutionally restrict dissenting views .
Without comment , justices let stand a lower court ruling that said South Carolina 's license plates , which bear the slogan `` Choose Life , '' violate the First Amendment because abortion rights supporters were n't given a similar forum to express their beliefs .
Say what ?? Now the First Amendment guarantees all sides a fair voice ?
Where were liberals when Ralf Nader wanted such equality ?
And who on Earth could possibly have a problem with someone who paid $ 70 that went to a local crisis pregnancy program for an anti-abortion license plate ?
Oh that 's right .
The dastardly people at Planned Parenthood .
Because no one should be allowed to express an opinion that challenges the beliefs of the American Left .
