Re : Iran To Continue Policy of Shooting-Down US Spy Drones
I wonder why the Army and Marines do not deploy infantry combat drones .

That would be a long drive to any nuclear facility .
Someone 's BOUND to notice .
Hmmm ... now if the drone aircraft could lift a drone soldier and parachute ... .
Oh well , I do n't think there 's really much we CAN do about Iranian nukes .
Learning from others mistakes they 've widely dispersed their facilities , even put some in dense urban areas .
We will just have to lay down the law relative to what HAPPENS if Iranian uranium is found in a terrorist nuke .

Yep .
The Persians are n't so dumb , are they ?

But just how exactly would we ever be able to learn where fission material came from forensically ?
Sounds like a fantasy ...
As dangerous as this world is getting , we better think about being a better neighbor .
JMHO .

Um ... you 're not very technical , are you ?
Every reactor produces not only the fissionable products you want for bombs but also certain contaminates with a unique percentage of isotopes .
It 's a `` fingerprint '' that would be really hard to fake .
Sure ... but there are LIMITS ...

Does n't do you any good if you do n't have a fingerprint on file to which to compare the unknown one .

Ah ... but we DO !
We got it in two ways .
First from IAEC inspectors and secondly , in case some fakery was going on , from our low-flying drones that buzzed - and ` sniffed ' - their facilities .
