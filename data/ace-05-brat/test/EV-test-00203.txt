Post-trip report - London
Hi All ,
We * just * got back into Washington last evening , after our brief 5-day trip to London .
Thanks for all of the responses to my earlier inquiries , I 'm happy to report that everything went pretty well , but both my wife and I are pretty beat/tired .
We got into Heathrow on Monday morning .
At the airport , I got some cash from the Barclays ATM just outside the arrival area , as many have suggested .
FYI , I just checked my bank account , and we got charged a $ 2.00 fee and the exchange rate was around $ 1.92 / GPB .
After that , we took the underground into London .
Zone 1-6 all-day pass cost 5.40 GBP each .
That was pretty easy ... the most difficult part was finding the hotel once we finally got off at the final tube station .
The hotel was nice enough to let us check in , even though we were a bit early -LRB- we got in around 12:30 , normal check-in time was 14:30 -RRB- , which we were really grateful for , after dragging our bags for a couple of hours .
After settling into the hotel room -LRB- my wife is an `` unpack everything-and-stow it '' type of person -RRB- , we went to do a little exploring .
Being that this was a holiday , a lot of the local places were closed -LRB- including restaurants in the hotel -RRB- , but we found a kind of combo newsagent/foodstore nearby , and we picked up a 5 GBP calling card -LRB- for calling home -RRB- and some drinks -LRB- 1.59 GPB for ~ 2 liter Pepsi light , .98 GBP for a ~ 2 liter water -RRB- .
It took us awhile , but we found a restaurant/pub -LRB- White Swan -RRB- that was open .
It seemed like a kind of local place , and the woman that was running the place was very nice .
When we walked in , we stood around waiting to be seated :-RRB- , and she said `` this is a pub , sit anywhere , and order at the bar '' .
I gathered -LRB- from that and a few visits at other pubs -RRB- that that 's the norm .
Anyway , we had a nice late lunch : fish and chips -LRB- with `` mashed peas '' -RRB- for me , and a beef pie for my wife .
FYI , this was probably the most reasonable meal that we had during our whole visit .
That night , we walked around the area around the Victoria underground station , because we were suppose to meet up with a tour the next morning .
While there , we found a local Sainsbury -LRB- kind of a small supermarket -RRB- about 2 blocks from the underground station , and stocked up on some cheese , milk , and croissants .
Prices here were a bit cheaper than the local foodstore , and during our trip , I made several trips here :-RRB- .
We were n't sure what we wanted to eat for dinner , so we just wandered around a bit , and finally ended up at a `` steakhouse '' near the station ... big mistake .
The food , service , and prices were very bad ... I guess we should have figured that one out when 3 other parties walked out AFTER being seated , but unfortunately , we had already ordered , so we felt kind of obligated to finish .
I do n't know if this is the case with all `` steakhouses '' , but we stayed away from them all after that :-LRB- .
We took an all day bus tour -LRB- Evan Evans -RRB- , including the London Eye .
Took the underground to Victoria , and walked to the Victoria Coach Station -LRB- it 's NOT the same :-RRB- -RRB- .
I thought that the tour was a pretty good way to get introduced to part of the city .
We got to see a lot in a short time , including extended tours of Westminster -LRB- felt kind of strange walking over dead people -RRB- and the Tower of London -LRB- neat !
-RRB- .
This tour included lunch at another pub near Trafalgar Square -LRB- more beef pies for us -RRB- , and the tour guide was very good , and kind of funny .
It was kind of like travelling with a `` grand dad '' and he did his best to keep us all together .
At the end of the land tour , we went on ride on one of the Thames cruise boats -LRB- warning , it is FREEZING on the top deck ... -RRB- , and then a ride on the London Eye .
All in all , recommended , but afterwards , both my wife and I agreed that an `` all-day '' tour was too exhausting -LRB- even on a bus tour , you have to do a LOT of walking especially getting to the Changing of the Guards and at the London Tower -RRB- , and we probably would 've preferred breaking it into 2Â 1/2 day tours .
We also took one of the hop-on/hop-off bus tours -LRB- the `` Original '' -RRB- on one of the other day , as we thought it was the easiest way to get around to the places that we wanted to re-visit .
A couple of comments : take the one with the live guide if you can , as it 's much more interesting than the ones with the recorded commentary -LRB- you can ask questions -RRB- .
Also , if you want to get a seat on the top deck , take one of the earlier buses , as at least when we were there , it was impossible to get a seat on top later in the day , and you ca n't see much from the lower -LRB- enclosed -RRB- deck -LRB- but it 's much warmer :-RRB- !
-RRB- .
We had been buying the 2-zone all-day tube passes -LRB- 4.20 GBP each -RRB- everyday , just to get around to dinner and shopping on our own , but by the time this was all over , my wife did n't feel like taking the underground back to Heathrow , so we had asked the hotel conceierge to make a reservation on an airport bus -LRB- 15 GBP each -RRB- , but he instead offered that he could get us a private car direct to the airport for 35 GBP , which is what we did .
This was perfect , because it got us door-to-door from the hotel to LHR Terminal 3 with no hassles at all .
I would n't have done that from LHR to the hotel , but since the concierge was arranging it , I felt that it 'd be safe , and the driver turned out to be pretty nice .
Overall , it was an enjoyable , but really exhausting trip -LRB- we live in the suburbs , so I guess we 're not use to walking everywhere -RRB- .
Luckily this was n't a `` shopping '' trip , because things are -LRB- at least from Americans -RRB- really expensive .
I think that if I was dealing in GPBs all the time , it would n't seem so bad , but I remember sitting at the ice cream -LRB- `` gelato '' ?
-RRB- counter at Harrods , and watching two little kids , each eating some sundaes that cost 15 GPB each -LRB- $ 30.00 -RRB- , and thinking `` wow !
'' .

Re : Post-trip report - London
Oh dear !
Spot the Americans !
:o-RRB-
Angus Steakhouse by any chance ?
I have never heard anything but bad stuff about them .
They are not British in the food sense , that 's for sure .
Pub food is usually a good bet in the UK .
That 's a Europe thing .
The cities invariably involve a lot of walking , and this is seen as a pleasure , not a task .
That 's very expensive , even by London standards .
Harrods is Harrods though , and most people go there to be blown away by the prices .
Of course everyone feels compelled to buy ` something ' .
I opted for a few chocolates , which were very good .
Good report of a good trip , even if you did fall for a couple of the tourist traps !
