Elections Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election ?
What did you think of the two candidates , George Bush and John Kerry ?
What about the Vice Presidential candidates , Dick Cheney and John Edwards ?
What issues were most important to you in deciding who to vote for ?
If you did n't vote , why not ?
Obo
Hello , my my name is Obo in Ithaca , New York
Ted
Hi , my na - -- Hey , my name is Ted and I 'm in Jacksonville , Florida .
Obo
Oh , nice , sounds like it 's a lot warmer down there .
Ted
Oh yeah , sun 's shining , it 's a beautiful day .
Obo
Yeah , I guess the elections , ah -- basically , who did you vote for , and the vice presidential candidates , and why , and I 'll be honest with you
Ted
Yeah , go ahead .
Obo
I did n't vote for either of those .
Ted
Oh okay .
Obo
I did vote , but I I do n't vote for the main party
Ted
Uh-huh .
Obo
ever , I usually try to stay out of the main party , because I think , and this last election showed that both are very brutal .
Ted
It was
Obo
Um , yeah I think that the , uh
Ted
election .
Obo
Oh , I 'm sorry .
Ted
It was a very brutal election .
Obo
Yeah , yeah , it 's , yeah , you 're absolutely , yeah , and I 'm sorry , I mean , if you want to add anything I 'm sorry .
Ted
No no , go ahead , go ahead .
Obo
And , ah -- It 's , it 's just that -- Like , I I just , I think that the last fifty years , the government has been mes - messed up by both these parties , honestly .
Even maybe before that .
So , I , I usually do third party -- um , and the way it was working this year was that the Democrats really pushed to get Ralph Nader off the ballot
Ted
Yeah .
Yeah they did .
Obo
in every state , and um -- I mean , the Republicans sort of tried to play like they were helping him out , but they knew they they did n't really have to because they knew the Democrats were already doing more damage to keep him off the ballot and they were successful , and for a progressive party that was very brutal .
Ted
Mhm , it was .
Obo
And I was n't really impressed by either of the two vice presidential candidates , I know Dick Cheney seems to be running the show
Ted
You know ?
Obo
and , ah -- I mean , and , and a lot of it has to do -- and then , I just did n't know much , John Edwards seemed nice , but he just , you know , he was just , he just got elected to the Senate , and , I was n't really familiar too much with hi - I mean , I think it 's great that he got into the vice presidential role , but -- again , it 's the whole parties that I 'm really not really I do n't like their policies .
Ted
Well , you kind of hit on some of my sentiments , um , I 'm a fifty-year - old black male , and this was my first election that I participated in .
And the reason was was that , ah , I 'm retired Air Force -- and before , ah , because I was in the military -- ah , did n't did n't really think that my vote , um , counted one way or the other , that 's that was my thinking .
You know , I had a role to fulfill and regardless of how I voted , uh , I was going to have to fulfill that role .
Um ,
Obo
Yeah .
Ted
the , the situation , though , now that I 'm out and , in the civilian sector , um , I find that the economics as far as home -- is what I 'm most concerned with .
And because of the economic situation , I do n't think that 's being addressed .
Yes , I feel very , very bad in regards to the , ah , nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff
Obo
Mhm .
Ted
um , but I think so much attention is being paid to that -- that -- as you mentioned , over the past fifty years , the two parties that run the country -- um , have definitely taken a , um -- streamlined approach to whatever their agenda may be and not the will of the people .
Obo
You said it very well .
I totally , you coul - I could n't have said it better .
Ted
Now it 's uh -- and as time goes on , you know , like , ah , what are we , you know , headed for , what are we faced with ?
Obo
I I
Ted
I mean , if we do n't start looking inward and start taking care of things at home -- uh , right now , yeah , we are the biggest power in the world .
I heard a commentary by Rush Limbaugh , ah , the other day , and the comment was made was that there always is going to be a big dog on the street .
And right now I 'm proud to be , ah , you know , behind the big dog , meaning the United States .
If i - if if -- the United States is not the big dog , some power in the world is going to step up and be just that .
We got so many crises and tension uh what do you -- hot spots in the world , that , uh , instead of getting better , it seems to be growing .
We got , uh , what is it , Iran ?
Uh , right behind Iraq there .
And then North Korea , which is , you know , always volatile .
Uh , you know , those situations are not getting any better , you know ?
Obo
You 're absolutely right , yes .
Ted
And as far as -- You know , I mean , what are we going to do ?
We can - we can not -- police the whole world .
We , we truly can not .
