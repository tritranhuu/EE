Death of Arafat -LRB- 2 -RRB- PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week , after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death .
What do you think caused his illness , and could it have been something malicious -LRB- like poisoning -RRB- ?
What do you think of Israel 's policies surrounding Arafat 's illness and death ?
Should President Bush or a senior US official have attended Arafat 's funeral ?
Should Israel have let Arafat be buried in Jerusalem ?
Ed
Hello , this is Ed .
James
Uh , Hi , yeah , this is James .
Ed
Hey , James .
James
How you doing ?
Ed
Good .
James
Well , what do you think ?
Ed
I think I was on this one yesterday , same subject .
James
I , I believe I 've talked about this subject once before too .
Ed
Uh , Well , let 's see , my past views were , uh -- illness-wise , ah -- I do n't think -- it helped him , being in the compound .
James
Right .
Right .
Ed
But , You 're , you know , you 're never going to know if there was any , ah , clandestine-type operation that -- Aided his , ah -- ah , illness .
James
Mhm .
Ed
I think that they , ah , -LRB- -LRB- -RRB- -RRB- , I do n't think you 're ever going to find out if there was any direct
James
Right .
Ed
tampering
James
Right .
Ed
but I do n't , you know , from just the generic point , or general point of view , it did n't help his illness once he got -- sick -- being in the compound , closed in like that with the Arabs .
James
Right .
Right .
Ed
And that
James
I do n't -- I do n't know if I think there was something -- you know , malicious done , because , you know , looking back -- he 's been had this shaking thing going on
Ed
Yeah .
James
for quite some time .
And I agree that the surroundings could n't have helped .
Ed
Right .
James
Yeah , it , it could 've only exacerbated , uh , his situation .
Because for -- for a good little while now I 've noticed , you know , that his lips would tremble , and
Ed
Yeah .
James
and , you know , it 's like , um , uh , almost like he had , uh , what is that , Parkinson 's ?
Ed
Yeah .
James
Uh , something like that , but , uh , I do n't know what the exact conditions were -- in that compound , but they could n't have been could n't have been , ah , conducive to someone of his age -- and of his health -- and as far as , as , ah , the United States sending a senior ~ US official , I think they should 've sent someone -- I do n't know how senior that person had to be .
But , uh , it could 've been a gesture
Ed
Well they did -- they did send somebody , I thought .
Did n't they go with a senior official , I had
James
to
Ed
did n't think they were going to ask this question , but I
James
Oh y - yeah , you 're right , they did send someone .
Ed
but it was n't -- like , ah , was n't Bush , I definitely would n't send him , I do n't think you want to have him in that part of the world right now .
James
Right .
No .
No .
No , I do n't think
Ed
Regardless of what you think about him , he 's , ah
James
Yeah , I do n't think he should have went -- as a matter of fact , I do n't think any senior official should 've went , I do n't think -- Secretary of State Colin Powell should have went .
Uh , whoever they sent was , was good enough .
Ed
Yeah .
James
Yeah , was good enough , just to show -- the Palestinian people -- that , uh you know , America does care somewhat -- that you 've lost your leader .
But , uh , no , it would 've been -- it would 've been a wro - as a matter of fact , I think sending Bush would have made it worse .
You know .
Uh , because he 's not liked that much by the Palestinian people .
So I , I do n't think sending him would 've been -- would 've been the right thing to do .
Ed
No , I agree with that .
James
Yeah , I do n't think it would 've added anything to -- to the situation .
and possibly could 've made it worse .
Ed
Yeah .
James
Yeah .
Ed
As to -- his burial
James
Mhm .
Ed
ah , Not anymore , these are all , uh like these are all political responses
James
Huh .
Right .
Ed
you know , there is no right answer , considering that that is not
James
Mhm .
Ed
you know , they 're still arguing over -- that land , and is it , ah
James
Yeah .
Ed
who owns it and respect , so I mean it 's
James
Mhm .
I 'd say my overall opinion is that -- this conflict is way past that time .
Ed
Yeah , well ,
James
You know , it 's been going on for all these many -- what ,
Ed
Hundreds .
James
hundreds of years -- and a lot of people have lost their lives , and and a lot of kids have grown up and all they 've ever known -- on both sides Israeli and Palestinian , all they 've ever known is war .
And it 's just tiresome .
I mean , that 's , that 's my , my view , this thing has gone so long -- like you said , about a piece of land .
And it 's just , you know , They , they , they got to learn at some point -- that they 're going to have to be able to get along .
Or this is just going to keep going around , and around , and around , and , you know , the the -- the Palestinians will , will , will -- will -- will do something , then Israel will respond , and then back and forth -- and it 's just like a never ending circle .
Ed
Oh yeah .
James
It 's like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction .
And , like I said , I 'm personally just tired of it .
I think the world is just tired of it .
Ed
Oh yeah .
James
You know .
And they need to try and , try and , I , I mean , I do n't have the answer .
You know , I do n't have all the answers .
I just know that it is just -- just an ongoing situation that is - there seems to be -- no end in sight .
Ed
I agree .
