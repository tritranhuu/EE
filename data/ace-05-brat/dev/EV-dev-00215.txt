Death of Arafat -LRB- 1 -RRB- Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week .
Do you think Arafat 's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process ?
Was Arafat a good leader ?
What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died ?
What , if anything , should the US do to be involved in the Middle East peace process ?
Rainia
Hello .
Paul
Hi , this is Paul .
Rainia
Hi .
Where are you from ?
Paul
I 'm in Delaware .
Rainia
Delaware .
And my name is Rainia and I 'm in Eureka , California .
Paul
Wow .
Opposite sides of the coast .
Rainia
Yeah .
Well , that 's an interesting question they 're asking .
Paul
Yeah , it is , uh , the past couple of topics have been -- more controversial than -- the early topics -- and , uh , well , I 'm - I 'm very opinionated .
I 'm happy to talk about it .
Rainia
Yeah , go right ahead .
Paul
Well , um , Yasser Arafat was -- was he a good leader ?
I I think -- that , uh , he -- he 's -- pretty much -- -- or he was pretty much -- following what he had always done , even as a young man , uh , back in Algeria -- when - when he led the -- terrorist attacks against the French to kick them out of -- Algeria .
And I - I think he was doing the same thing there in Palestine .
I - I do n't think , eh , I do n't think he really knew how to , uh , take on the role of - of peacemaker .
You know , I 'm - I 'm -- you know , I could be wrong .
That 's just my opinion .
But i - it seems like that - that was always a problem for him .
Hm .
Rainia
Yeah .
Um , I 'm not sure myself uh how good a leader he was .
I I -- it 's hard to get the truth w - when the -- when the there 's so many uh slanted uh -- information
Paul
Yeah .
Rainia
especially on the main media .
Paul
That 's true .
Rainia
I do n't -- like the way -- Israel has been -- going after the Palestinians
Paul
Right .
I - I agree .
I think Ariel Sharon is a lot like Yasser Arafat .
And I -- ca n't understand why the two of them -- did n't see the similarities .
Rainia
Yeah .
Um , and they were asking -- too , of -- about the , should the ~ US be involved -- in that whole thing ?
Paul
Yeah .
That - that 's interesting , too , because -- cutting Yasser Arafat out of the whole thing was - -- was really -- George Bush 's decision .
I think -- personally , he did n't like him because he thought he was a - -- a liar -- so he refused to -- have anything to do with him .
And , uh , th -
Rainia
Uh , which - which Bush are you talking about ?
Paul
George ~ W Bush .
Rainia
Oh , ok - yeah .
Paul
-LRB- -LRB- -RRB- -RRB-
Rainia
Well -
Paul
Ev - everything kind of stopped when - -- when he became president and all , uh , activity regarding -- Israel , Palestine stopped .
And Israel pretty much could do what they wanted .
An - and you 're right , it did n't seem fair at all .
Rainia
Yeah , there 're -- th - well , the way I see it , eh , Bush , eh , has a right -- wing Christian , right-wing agenda .
He he 's -- some -- how thinks that -- if Israel has -- -- I 'm not sure that all -- their prophecies are -- but there 's something about -- if -- they can -- get rid of the Palestinians , that will somehow , um , their prophecy -- coming true and th - and then -- somehow -- I do n't -- I - we do n't -- understand what on Earth they 're
Paul
That sounds --
Rainia
trying to achieve with this but i - it seems like a -
Paul
that sounds kind of scary .
Rainia
a Christian agenda , yeah , that that -- that , uh , the end of the world , the end times -- if , um , Israel takes over -- Palestine that 's h - some -- has something to do with the end times .
It 's really -- frightening the way they talk -- and , um , I do n't think he 's qualified to be involved in this at all .
It never was right to begin with n - and , you know , we - we 're - we 're only given certain information and
Paul
Mhm .
Rainia
hard to really know the whole -- real story of what 's going on over there .
But I do know
Paul
Right .
Rainia
that what the Israelis are doing is wrong .
By going into their territory and building these walls or building settlements -- pushing the Palestinians out and -- Palestinians -- fight -- with rocks and -- sticks and -- Israelis have their machine guns and bulldozers and -- I just -- t - really unpalatable that the -- whole idea , the -- the way they 're going about -- this thing and -- I do n't really feel qualified -- to say how it should be , but -- I -- see it -- being wrong to -- hurt children and -- innocent people .
No matter what side they 're on
Paul
Right .
