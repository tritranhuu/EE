Would n't it be something if these formerly `` militant extremist '' Muslim regiemes became more liberal while the U.S. became ... ah ... never mind .

Cancer is not a happy thing .
Stomach cancer 's got to hurt like hell .

Re : Yasser Arafat declared Brain Dead
I have always wondered if cancer would hurt or not .
I take it that it does .

Consider yourself lucky that you had to wonder about it .
I became familiar with _ that _ issue at a very young age .
And many times thereafter .
To say that it `` hurts like hell '' is an understatement , at least the kinds my family had been prone to .
When you see the woman who raised you sucking desperately on a dropper of liquid morphine like it were her own mother 's teat , you 're just never quite the same .
The `` woman who raised me '' was n't actually my mother , but my grandmother , btw .

Might just be conspiracy stuff but OTOH Mossad does have a reputation for highly effective operations .
I do n't think it is likely but I would not be surprised either .

Re : Yasser Arafat declared Brain Dead
The Palestinians want land to live on , while Sharon wants no Palestinians living on the land .
When the world finally grows the balls to criticize Israeli terrorism , we 'll see peace .
But as long as `` criticism is anti-semitism '' is the mentality , do n't act surprised that the Palestinians object to the Lebensraum -LRB- a/k/a settlements -RRB- and Israeli terrorism -LRB- bombings , shooting farmers in their fields , bulldozing crops , destroying schools , shooting children , etc. etc. etc. -RRB- .
George Carlin said it best : `` Let 's not have a double standard , one standard will do just fine .
'' Apply the same standards to Israel that we apply to the Palestinians .

I think more likely , one of his palestinian rivals did it .
If the israelis wanted to kill Arafat , I think they 'd have better ways .
Unless of course they wanted it to be succinct so they could n't be blamed .
But one thing that 's sure about the palestinians is that no matter what happens , you can be sure they 'll blame it on Israel .

I guess the fact that you live in the US has skewed your view .
Bill after bill of condemnation have passed in the United Nations by overwhelming majority .
Regular as clockwork , the US vetos them .
Demonstrations are routinely held against israel all over the world .
Israel 's only friend in the world is the United States .
Here in ` the rest of the world ' it 's the other way around .
When you 're a muslim you 're untouchable , when you 're israeli , you 're fair game .
When in it 's 60 year long history has Israel ever stepped up the conflict , or cast the first stone ?
Everyone has the right to defend themselves .
Even jews .
May I interpret this as your approving of the Nazi extermination of slavic people ?
The extermination of kosovar albanians by native serbs ?
Come talk to me once you decide a jewish and a muslim life are worth the same .
