Death of Arafat -LRB- 1 -RRB- Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week .
Do you think Arafat 's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process ?
Was Arafat a good leader ?
What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died ?
What , if anything , should the US do to be involved in the Middle East peace process ?
Gandhi
Hi , good evening .
Marco
Hi .
Wha - I did n't catch your name .
What 's your name ?
Gandhi
Gandhi from New York .
You ?
Marco
Gindhi ?
Gandhi
New York .
Yeah .
Marco
From New York .
Gandhi
Yeah .
Marco
Uh , Marco from Illinois .
Gandhi
Okay , Mark .
Uh , I think it 's fresh topic for tonight .
Marco
Yeah , yeah .
Good topic .
It 's a good topic .
Gandhi
So what do you think ?
Marco
Well , um , I would - I would have to start - -- I would have to start , generally , in stating - -- stating what I think is the problem and -- - with the Middle East and what - For me , one of the major problems is the fact that -- the -- United States government gives so much aid to the state of Israel .
In which , the state of Israel buys -- many expensive military weapons , ah , which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of Palestinians .
So , for me , that 's -- the - that 's essentially the root of the problem .
And , um , Yasser Arafat was kind of in a difficult position , because you have these , um , incredibly -- oppressed and in some ways imprisoned , uh , Palestinians , and if -- Arafat had n't , um , tried to stand up -- and help them and - and fight for their rights , then -- m - they would n't have respected Arafat , but then again , you know , he could n't be too friendly with the West , um , and , um , and so he did the best he could , I think .
It 's a difficult -- leadership role .
Gandhi
Mhm .
Marco
Yeah .
Um , what do - Well , how about you ?
Gandhi
I think , yeah , more or less , I c - I agree with what you said .
It 's almost , this is my view as well .
And the question is , what next ?
I mean , some idea -- from Israeli side , they were saying -- he was a problem , and if he goes , everything will be quite easy .
Marco
Yeah .
Gandhi
Fine .
Now he 's not in anymore .
Marco
Yeah .
Gandhi
So , let us wait and see .
Hope .
If he was a problem himself , hope - uh , the coming one -- will be in a good -- position to negotiate with the other side , Israel , and then -- peace can be achieved .
Marco
Yeah .
Gandhi
Uh , we have to wait and see , but , uh , it seems it 's not easy .
Marco
But , I , eh , I get the feeling that - -- It 's almost - -- The peace process - We ca n't put it on -- the ro - or the - -- the whole responsibility of the pre - -- peace process ca n't be the leader of -- a - -- a group that is - -- I do n't know , in my view , has -- not ver - not very many resources to fight - -- to fight this -- battle that -- their trying to fight against -- a government that has taken away a lot of their land , that , you know , does n't allow them to really move around in their own country .
So , unless that -- stops , the , um , the leader of the Palestinians -- really ca n't do too much -- to further the peace process , because -- there are -- a lot of bad things happening to the people -- of that -- leader .
Gandhi
That 's correct , as well .
Marco
Yeah , so it 's - -- it 's kind of , it 's - -- it seems like the , um , the media , at least in the United States , is -- putting all of this -- focus and responsibility on the leader of the Palestinians , as if it was
Gandhi
Marco
Arafat 's fault that any of - -- any of the violence was caused .
So , it seems like an unfair treatment -- of - -- of , you know , the leader of -- the Palestinian people .
Um , yeah .
Gandhi
Yes .
That 's absolutely correct .
Yeah .
Marco
Yeah .
Hm .
Gandhi
Actually , it - it 's a good topic to be choosing , I mean , uh , because it 's one of the fresh topics .
Marco
Yeah .
Gandhi
How long have you been with the study ?
Marco
Uh , this is probably my tenth or eleventh conversation .
Gandhi
Tenth , eleven .
Almost the same like me .
So , the other -- days , which one was quite interesting to you ?
Marco
Um , well , there 's been a couple where -- they 've - they talked about the Cabinet -- for -- Bush , and Bush has been , um , you know , selecting new Cabinet members and -- all of the new members are people that I 'm - I do n't really know very well .
So , there 's been some topics where I 'm - I did n't have very much information .
Other topics -- you know , usually about the election that - -- that , um , I did have -- a lot of things , um , to say .
Yeah .
Are you - are you , um , are you from the United States , or do you come from , uh -
Gandhi
I came from the area , I 'm from Egypt .
Marco
You 're from Egypt .
Gandhi
Yeah , so I 'm - I 'm quite , uh ,
Marco
So you -
Gandhi
- cerned about , uh - -- uh , over there I mean .
People , actually , they are waiting -- to , uh , to see peace is a fact .
Actually , in both sides ,
Marco
Yeah .
