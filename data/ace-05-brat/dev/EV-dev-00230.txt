Brady Campaign Fails Nation With `` Report Cards ''

In a horribly deceitful manner , the Brady Campaign has released `` report cards '' for every state on their gun laws that supposedly shield children from gun violence .
Thirty-one states received either a `` D '' or an `` F '' from the anti-gun group .
I 've got all the goods in a new article I wrote for GunControlPolicy.com .
Not surprisingly my home state of Florida received a `` D + '' for reasons that are just plain laughable and of course have nothing to do with kids .
