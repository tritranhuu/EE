I	O
usually	O
try	O
to	O
stay	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

because	O
I	O
think	O
and	O
this	O
last	O

showed	O
that	O
both	O
are	O
very	O
brutal	O
.	O

Ted	O

uh	O

Obo	O

Oh	O
I	O
'm	O

It	O
's	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
that	O

I	O
I	O
just	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
last	O
fifty	O
years	O
the	O
government	O
has	O
been	O
mes	O
messed	O
up	O
by	O
both	O
these	O

honestly	O
.	O

Even	O
maybe	O
before	O
that	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
I	O
usually	O
do	O
third	O
party	O
--	O
um	O
and	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
was	O
working	O
this	O
year	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
Democrats	O
really	O
pushed	O
to	O
get	O
Ralph	O
Nader	O
off	O
the	O
ballot	O

Ted	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Yeah	O
they	O
did	O
.	O

Obo	O

in	O
every	O
state	O
and	O
um	O
--	O
I	O
mean	O
the	O
Republicans	O
sort	O
of	O
tried	O
to	O
play	O
like	O
they	O
were	O
helping	O
him	O
out	O
but	O
they	O
knew	O
they	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
really	O
have	O
to	O
because	O
they	O
knew	O
the	O
Democrats	O
were	O
already	O
doing	O
more	O
damage	O
to	O
keep	O
him	O
off	O
the	O
ballot	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
successful	O
and	O
for	O
a	O
progressive	O
party	O
that	O
was	O
very	O
brutal	O
.	O

Ted	O

Mhm	O
it	O
was	O
.	O

Obo	O

And	O
I	O
was	O
n't	O
really	O
impressed	O
by	O
either	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
vice	O
presidential	O

I	O

You	O
know	O
?	O

Obo	O

and	O
ah	O

and	O
and	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
it	O
has	O
to	O
do	O
--	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
just	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
much	O
John	O
Edwards	O
seemed	O
nice	O
but	O
he	O
just	O
you	O

he	O
was	O
just	O
he	O
just	O
got	O
elected	Elect

I	O
was	O

did	O
n't	O
did	O
n't	O
really	O

that	O
my	O

um	O
counted	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
the	O

that	O
's	O
that	O
was	O
my	O

You	O

I	O
had	O
a	O

that	O
I	O
'm	O
out	O

in	O
the	O

I	O
find	O
that	O

is	O
what	O
I	O
'm	O

because	O
of	O
the	O

Also	O
the	O
Pentagon	O
is	O
seeing	O
lighter	O
than	O
expected	O
resistance	O
indicating	O
at	O

that	O
they	O
may	O
have	O
really	O

degraded	O
those	O

that	O

According	O
to	O
the	O
usually	O
reliable	O
CNN/Money	O
the	O
``	O
Twin	O
Deficits	O
''	O
will	O
continue	O
to	O
grow	O
.	O

Interesting	O
terminology	O
...	O
I	O
believe	O
they	O
're	O
referring	O
to	O
the	O
budget	O
deficit	O
and	O
...	O
the	O
capital	O
surplus	O
?	O

When	O
analyzing	O
trade	O
deficits	O
it	O
's	O
important	O
to	O
realize	O
that	O
the	O
amount	O
by	O
which	O
imports	O
exceed	O
exports	O
is	O
also	O
equal	O
to	O
the	O
net	O
amount	O
foreign	O
investors	O
have	O
bet	O
on	O
the	O
US	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
trade	O
deficit	O
is	O
due	O
to	O
a	O
confluence	O
of	O
the	O
pressures	O
from	O
US	O
consumers	O
-LRB-	O
who	O
control	O
about	O
20	O
of	O
global	O
GDP	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
everybody	O
else	O
-LRB-	O
excluding	O
the	O
non-consumption	O
share	O
of	O
US	O
GDP	O
that	O
would	O
amount	O
to	O
around	O
75	O
of	O
global	O
GDP	O
-RRB-	O
.	O

Which	O
of	O
those	O
is	O
--	O
probably	O
--	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
more	O
important	O
number	O
?	O

Even	O
if	O
we	O
are	O
consumers	O
bent	O
on	O
gorging	O
ourselves	O
with	O
imported	O
goods	O
the	O
largest	O
pressure	O
on	O
the	O
deficit	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
simply	O
a	O
better	O
place	O
for	O
investment	O
--	O
higher	O
returns	O
on	O
capital	O
in	O
developing	O
countries	O
are	O
more	O
than	O
mitigated	O
by	O
the	O
higher	O
political	O
risks	O
they	O
face	O
.	O

And	O
what	O
about	O
that	O
other	O
deficit	O
?	O

It	O
of	O
course	O
is	O
the	O
ominous	O
sum	O
that	O
we	O
fund	O
without	O
taxes	O
but	O
by	O
borrowing	O
funds	O
.	O

And	O
about	O
half	O
of	O
those	O
borrowings	O
end	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
major	O

in	O
Asia	O

not	O

Would	O

you	O

by	O
non-US	O

I	O
just	O

I	O
I	O

I	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
idea	O

them	O
going	O
in	O
there	O
--	O
and	O
doing	O
what	O
they	O
did	O
but	O
uh	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
short	O
window	O
of	O
opportunity	O
to	O
win	O
over	O
the	O
people	O
and	O
it	O
did	O

if	O
that	O
was	O

I	O

uh	O
they	O
did	O
a	O
great	O
job	O
up	O

of	O
course	O
.	O

You	O
know	O
they	O
did	O
militarily-wise	O
they	O
did	O
an	O

I	O
think	O
they	O
've	O
done	O
a	O
poor	O

you	O
know	O
reconstructing	O
and	O
just	O
controlling	O

You	O
know	O
they	O

Allan	O

Yeah	O
I	O
I	O

Yeah	O
I	O
I	O
mean	O
I	O
I	O
did	O
support	O
the	O
war	Attack
.	O

I	O
just	O
think	O
that	O
when	O
they	O
went	O
in	O
there	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
--	O
they	O
just	O
did	O

i	O
execute	O
everything	O
correctly	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
was	O
problems	O
you	O
know	O
.	O

A	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Allan	O

And	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
mean	O
that	O
that	O
lead	O
to	O
it	O
but	O
yeah	O
I	O
mean	O
they	O
--	O
I	O
mean	O
eh	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
're	O
already	O
in	O
it	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
should	O
n't	O
--	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
just	O
walk	O
down	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
stop	O
you	O
got	O
to	O
complete	O
what	O
you	O
're	O
doing	O
you	O
know	O
.	O

So	O
I	O

A	O

Right	O
.	O

Allan	O

Yeah	O
um	O
.	O

A	O

But	O
they	O
they	O
definitely	O
need	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
back	O

to	O
some	O
sort	O

you	O
know	O
some	O

know	O
they	O
set	Start-Org
up	Start-Org
the	O

Um	O
they	O
still	O
--	O
Americans	O
have	O

So	O
if	O
they	O
can	O
just	O

of	O
make	O
a	O

be	O
get	O
into	O
more	O

flex	O
their	O

him	O
he	O

I	O

was	O

just	O

that	O
uh	O
you	O

uh	O

it	O
would	O
've	O

a	O
wro	O

because	O

Sara	O

Uh-huh	O

he	O

really	O
young	O
and	O
he	O
's	O
going	O

Sara	O

Uh-huh	O

that	O

Hi	O
All	O

We	O
just	O
got	Transport
back	Transport
into	O
Washington	O
last	O
evening	O
after	O
our	O
brief	O
5-day	O
trip	Transport
to	O
London	O
.	O

Thanks	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
responses	O
to	O
my	O
earlier	O
inquiries	O
I	O
'm	O
happy	O
to	O
report	O
that	O
everything	O
went	O
pretty	O
well	O
but	O
both	O
my	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
are	O
pretty	O
beat/tired	O
.	O

We	O
got	Transport
into	O
Heathrow	O
on	O
Monday	O
morning	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
airport	O
I	O
got	O
some	O
cash	O
from	O
the	O
Barclays	O
ATM	O
just	O
outside	O
the	O
arrival	O
area	O
as	O
many	O
have	O
suggested	O
.	O

FYI	O
I	O
just	O
checked	O
my	O
bank	O
account	O
and	O
we	O
got	O
charged	O
a	O
2.00	O
fee	O
and	O
the	O
exchange	O
rate	O
was	O
around	O
1.92	O

After	O
that	O
we	O
took	Transport

That	O
was	O
pretty	O
easy	O
...	O
the	O
most	O
difficult	O
part	O
was	O
finding	O
the	O
hotel	O
once	O
we	O
finally	O
got	O
off	O
at	O
the	O
final	O
tube	O
station	O
.	O

The	O
hotel	O
was	O
nice	O
enough	O
to	O
let	O
us	O
check	O
in	O
even	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
bit	O
early	O
-LRB-	O
we	O
got	O
in	O
around	O
12:30	O
normal	O
check-in	O
time	O
was	O
14:30	O
-RRB-	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
really	O
grateful	O
for	O
after	O
dragging	O
our	O
bags	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
hours	O

-RRB-	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
little	O
exploring	O

Being	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
holiday	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
local	O
places	O
were	O
closed	O
-LRB-	O
including	O
restaurants	O
in	O
the	O
hotel	O
-RRB-	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
combo	O
newsagent/foodstore	O
nearby	O
and	O
we	O
picked	O
up	O
a	O
5	O
GBP	O
calling	O
card	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
calling	O
home	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
some	O

for	O
a	O

2	O
liter	O

-RRB-	O
.	O

It	O
took	O
us	O
awhile	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
restaurant/pub	O
-LRB-	O
White	O
Swan	O
-RRB-	O
that	O
was	O
open	O
.	O

It	O
seemed	O
like	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
local	O
place	O
and	O
the	O
woman	O
that	O
was	O
running	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
very	O
nice	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
walked	O
in	O
we	O
stood	O
around	O
waiting	O
to	O
be	O
seated	O
:-RRB-	O
and	O
she	O
said	O
``	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
pub	O
sit	O
anywhere	O
and	O
order	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
''	O
.	O

I	O
gathered	O
-LRB-	O
from	O
that	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
visits	O
at	O
other	O
pubs	O
-RRB-	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
norm	O
.	O

Anyway	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
nice	O
late	O
lunch	O
fish	O
and	O
chips	O
-LRB-	O
with	O
``	O
mashed	O
peas	O
''	O
-RRB-	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
a	O
beef	O
pie	O
for	O
my	O
wife	O
.	O

FYI	O
this	O
was	O
probably	O
the	O
most	O
reasonable	O
meal	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
during	O
our	O
whole	O
visit	O
.	O

That	O
night	O
we	O
walked	O
around	O
the	O
area	O
around	O
the	O
Victoria	O
underground	O
station	O
because	O
we	O
were	O
suppose	O
to	O
meet	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
tour	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
.	O

While	O
there	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
local	O
Sainsbury	O
-LRB-	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
supermarket	O
-RRB-	O
about	O
2	O
blocks	O
from	O
the	O
underground	O
station	O
and	O
stocked	O
up	O
on	O
some	O
cheese	O
milk	O
and	O
croissants	O
.	O

Prices	O
here	O
were	O
a	O
bit	O
cheaper	O
than	O
the	O
local	O
foodstore	O
and	O
during	O
our	O
trip	O
I	O
made	O
several	O
trips	Transport
here	O
:-RRB-	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
n't	O
sure	O
what	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
eat	O
for	O
dinner	O
so	O
we	O
just	O
wandered	O
around	O
a	O
bit	O
and	O
finally	O
ended	Transport
up	Transport
at	O
a	O
``	O
steakhouse	O
''	O
near	O
the	O
station	O
...	O
big	O
mistake	O
.	O

The	O
food	O
service	O
and	O
prices	O
were	O
very	O
bad	O
...	O
I	O
guess	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
figured	O
that	O
one	O
out	O
when	O
3	O
other	O
parties	O
walked	O
out	O
AFTER	O
being	O
seated	O
but	O
unfortunately	O
we	O
had	O
already	O
ordered	O
so	O
we	O
felt	O
kind	O
of	O
obligated	O
to	O
finish	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
case	O
with	O
all	O
``	O
steakhouses	O
''	O
but	O
we	O
stayed	O
away	O
from	O
them	O
all	O
after	O
that	O
:-LRB-	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
an	O
all	O
day	O
bus	O
tour	O
-LRB-	O
Evan	O
Evans	O
-RRB-	O
including	O
the	O
London	O

Took	Transport
the	O
underground	O
to	O
Victoria	O
and	O
walked	Transport
to	O
the	O
Victoria	O
Coach	O
Station	O
-LRB-	O
it	O
's	O
NOT	O
the	O
same	O
:-RRB-	O
-RRB-	O
.	O

I	O
thought	O
that	O
the	O
tour	O
was	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
introduced	O
to	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
city	O
.	O

We	O
got	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
including	O
extended	O
tours	O
of	O
Westminster	O
-LRB-	O
felt	O
kind	O
of	O
strange	O
walking	O
over	O
dead	O

-RRB-	O
and	O
the	O
Tower	O
of	O
London	O
-LRB-	O
neat	O

-RRB-	O
.	O

This	O
tour	O
included	O
lunch	O
at	O
another	O
pub	O
near	O
Trafalgar	O
Square	O
-LRB-	O
more	O
beef	O
pies	O
for	O
us	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
the	O
tour	O
guide	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
kind	O
of	O
funny	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
travelling	O
with	O
a	O
``	O
grand	O
dad	O
''	O
and	O
he	O
did	O
his	O
best	O
to	O
keep	O
us	O
all	O
together	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
tour	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
ride	O
on	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Thames	O

-LRB-	O
warning	O
it	O

...	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
ride	O
on	O
the	O
London	O

.	O

All	O
in	O
all	O
recommended	O
but	O
afterwards	O
both	O
my	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
agreed	O
that	O
an	O
``	O
all-day	O
''	O
tour	O
was	O
too	O
exhausting	O
-LRB-	O
even	O
on	O
a	O

you	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
LOT	O
of	O

especially	O
getting	O
to	O
the	O
Changing	O
of	O
the	O
Guards	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
London	O
Tower	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
we	O
probably	O
would	O
've	O
preferred	O
breaking	O
it	O
into	O
2	O
1/2	O

We	O
also	O
took	O

``	O

on	O
one	O
of	O

other	O

as	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
easiest	O
way	O
to	O

that	O

take	O

at	O

when	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O

a	O

We	O
had	O
been	O
buying	O
the	O
2-zone	O
all-day	O
tube	O
passes	O
-LRB-	O
4.20	O
GBP	O

just	O

by	O
the	O
time	O
this	O
was	O
all	O
over	O
my	O
wife	O
did	O
n't	O
feel	O
like	O
taking	Transport
the	O
underground	O
back	O
to	O
Heathrow	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
asked	O
the	O
hotel	O
conceierge	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
reservation	O
on	O
an	O
airport	O
bus	O
-LRB-	O
15	O
GBP	O
each	O
-RRB-	O
but	O
he	O
instead	O
offered	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
get	O
us	O
a	O
private	O
car	O
direct	Transport
to	O
the	O
airport	O
for	O
35	O
GBP	O
which	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
did	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
perfect	O
because	O
it	O
got	Transport
us	O
door-to-door	O
from	O
the	O
hotel	O
to	O
LHR	O
Terminal	O
3	O
with	O
no	O
hassles	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
n't	O
have	O
done	O
that	Transport
from	O
LHR	O
to	O
the	O
hotel	O
but	O
since	O
the	O
concierge	O
was	O
arranging	O
it	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
it	O
'd	O
be	O
safe	O
and	O
the	O
driver	O
turned	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
pretty	O
nice	O
.	O

Overall	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
enjoyable	O
but	O
really	O
exhausting	O
trip	O
-LRB-	O
we	O
live	O
in	O

so	O
I	O
guess	O
we	O
're	O
not	O
use	O
to	O
walking	O
everywhere	O
-RRB-	O
.	O

Luckily	O
this	O
was	O
n't	O
a	O
``	O

because	O
things	O
are	O
