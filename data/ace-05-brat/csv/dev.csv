Sometimes	O
the	O
program	O
would	O
also	O

them	O

even	O
where	O

The	O
big	O

-LRB-	O
Broward	O
for	O

-RRB-	O
went	O
to	O
Kerry	O

it	O
had	O
to	O
appear	O
that	O
everything	O
was	O
on	O

up	O
and	O
up	O

It	O
's	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O
this	O

Does	O
anybody	O
wonder	O
why	O
the	O
Republican	O
counties	O
were	O
mostly	O

after	O
the	O
Democratic	O
counties	O
?	O

You	O
should	O
wonder	O
and	O
also	O
know	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
no	O
accident	O
.	O

The	O
Bush	O
team	O
had	O
to	O
make	O
up	O
the	O
votes	O
as	O
the	O
night	O
went	O
on	O

In	O
Ohio	O
computer	O
voting	O
fraud	O
vote	O
tossing	O
and	O
voter	O
suppression	O
were	O
the	O
main	O
methods	O
.	O

Vote	O
tossing	O
was	O
simply	O
the	O
removal	O
of	O
Kerry	O
votes	O
and	O
some	O
third	O
party	O
votes	O
.	O

In	O
some	O
areas	O
the	O
Bush	O
vs.	O
Kerry	O
votes	O
were	O
absurd	O
.	O

Nine	O
to	O
one	O
eight	O
to	O
two	O
.	O

Voter	O
suppression	O
took	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
making	O
voters	O
stand	O
in	O
four	O
hour	O
long	O
lines	O
.	O

This	O
of	O
course	O
took	O
place	O
in	O
Democratic	O
areas	O
.	O

The	O
simplest	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O
was	O
to	O
have	O
too	O
few	O
voting	O
machines	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
that	O
's	O
all	O
it	O
takes	O
.	O

People	O
eventually	O
lose	O
patience	O
and	O
leave	O
without	O
casting	O
a	O
vote	O
.	O

In	O
other	O
states	O
such	O
as	O
New	O
Mexico	O
Nevada	O
Iowa	O
and	O
New	O
Hampshire	O
Kerry	O
's	O
leads	O
evaporated	O
very	O
quickly	O
once	O
the	O
polls	O
were	O
shut	O
down	O
.	O

Kerry	O
only	O
won	O
New	O
Hampshire	O
but	O
barely	O
.	O

As	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
the	O
lead	O
was	O
6	O
for	O
Kerry	O
in	O
that	O
state	O
and	O
not	O
enough	O
fraudulent	O
activity	O
took	O
place	O
to	O
flip	O
the	O
state	O
to	O
Bush	O
.	O

So	O
this	O
will	O
all	O
come	O
out	O
and	O
be	O
known	O
to	O
everyone	O

Nothing	O

Uh	O
Marco	O
from	O

Gandhi	O

Okay	O
Mark	O

Uh	O
I	O

it	O
's	O
fresh	O

for	O
tonight	O

yeah	O

Good	O
topic	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
topic	O
.	O

Gandhi	O

So	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
?	O

Marco	O

Well	O
um	O
I	O
would	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
start	O
--	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
start	O
generally	O
in	O
stating	O
--	O
stating	O
what	O
I	O
think	O
is	O
the	O
problem	O
and	O
--	O
with	O
the	O
Middle	O
East	O
and	O
what	O
For	O
me	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
major	O
problems	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
--	O
the	O
--	O
United	O
States	O
government	O
gives	Transfer-Money
so	O
much	O
aid	O
to	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
Israel	O
.	O

In	O
which	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
Israel	O
buys	Transfer-Ownership
--	O
many	O
expensive	O
military	O
weapons	O
ah	O
which	O
is	O
used	O
to	O
--	O
oppress	O
and	O
--	O
to	O
kill	Die
a	O
lot	O
of	O
Palestinians	O
.	O

So	O
for	O
me	O
that	O
's	O
--	O
the	O
that	O
's	O
essentially	O
the	O
root	O
of	O
the	O
problem	O
.	O

And	O
um	O
Yasser	O
Arafat	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
in	O
a	O
difficult	O
position	O
because	O
you	O
have	O
these	O
um	O
incredibly	O
--	O
oppressed	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
ways	O
imprisoned	O
uh	O
Palestinians	O
and	O
if	O
--	O
Arafat	O
had	O
n't	O
um	O
tried	O
to	O
stand	O
up	O
--	O
and	O
help	O
them	O
and	O
and	O
fight	Attack
for	O
their	O
rights	O
then	O
--	O
m	O
they	O
would	O
n't	O
have	O
respected	O
Arafat	O
but	O
then	O
again	O
you	O
know	O
he	O
could	O
n't	O
be	O
too	O
friendly	O
with	O
the	O
West	O
um	O
and	O
um	O
and	O
so	O
he	O
did	O
the	O
best	O
he	O
could	O
I	O
think	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
difficult	O
--	O
leadership	O
role	O
.	O

Gandhi	O

Mhm	O
.	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Um	O
what	O
do	O
Well	O
how	O
about	O
you	O
?	O

Gandhi	O

I	O
think	O
yeah	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
I	O
c	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
what	O
you	O
said	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
almost	O
this	O
is	O
my	O
view	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
question	O
is	O
what	O
next	O
?	O

I	O
mean	O
some	O
idea	O
--	O
from	O
Israeli	O
side	O
they	O
were	O
saying	O
--	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
problem	O
and	O
if	O
he	O
goes	O
everything	O
will	O
be	O
quite	O
easy	O
.	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Gandhi	O

Fine	O
.	O

Now	O
he	O
's	O
not	O
in	O
anymore	O
.	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Gandhi	O

So	O
let	O
us	O
wait	O
and	O
see	O
.	O

Hope	O
.	O

If	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
problem	O
himself	O
hope	O
uh	O
the	O
coming	O
one	O
--	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
good	O
--	O
position	O
to	O
negotiate	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
Israel	O
and	O
then	O
--	O
peace	O
can	O
be	O
achieved	O
.	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Gandhi	O

Uh	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
and	O
see	O
but	O
uh	O
it	O
seems	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
easy	O
.	O

Marco	O

But	O
I	O
eh	O
I	O
get	O
the	O
feeling	O
that	O
--	O
It	O
's	O
almost	O
--	O
The	O
peace	O
process	O
We	O
ca	O
n't	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
--	O
the	O
ro	O
or	O
the	O
--	O
the	O
whole	O
responsibility	O
of	O
the	O
pre	O
--	O
peace	O
process	O
ca	O
n't	O
be	O
the	O
leader	O
of	O
--	O
a	O
--	O
a	O
group	O
that	O
is	O
--	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
in	O
my	O
view	O
has	O
--	O
not	O
ver	O
not	O
very	O
many	O
resources	O
to	O
fight	O
--	O
to	O
fight	O
this	O
--	O
battle	O
that	O
--	O
their	O
trying	O
to	O
fight	O
against	O
--	O
a	O
government	O
that	O
has	O
taken	O
away	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
their	O
land	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
does	O
n't	O
allow	O
them	O
to	O
really	O
move	O
around	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
country	O
.	O

So	O
unless	O
that	O
--	O
stops	O
the	O
um	O
the	O
leader	O
of	O
the	O
Palestinians	O
--	O
really	O
ca	O
n't	O
do	O
too	O
much	O
--	O
to	O
further	O
the	O
peace	O
process	O
because	O
--	O
there	O
are	O
--	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
bad	O
things	O
happening	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
--	O
of	O
that	O
--	O
leader	O
.	O

Gandhi	O

That	O
's	O
correct	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
so	O
it	O
's	O
--	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
it	O
's	O
--	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
the	O
um	O
the	O
media	O
at	O
least	O
in	O
the	O
United	O
States	O
is	O
--	O
putting	O
all	O
of	O
this	O
--	O
focus	O
and	O
responsibility	O
on	O
the	O
leader	O
of	O
the	O
Palestinians	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
was	O

Gandhi	O

Marco	O

Arafat	O
's	O
fault	O
that	O
any	O
of	O
--	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
violence	O
was	O
caused	O
.	O

So	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
an	O
unfair	O
treatment	O
--	O
of	O
--	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
leader	O
of	O
--	O
the	O
Palestinian	O
people	O
.	O

Um	O
yeah	O
.	O

Gandhi	O

Yes	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
absolutely	O
correct	O

's	O
important	O

It	O
's	O
important	O
in	O
the	O

that	O
we	O

BLITZER	O

how	O

is	O
it	O
for	O

what	O

DODD	O

Well	O
it	O
's	O
important	O

But	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
as	O
important	O
as	O
finding	O
Osama	O
bin	O

for	O
the	O
simple	O
reason	O
that	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
Saddam	O
Hussein	O
today	O
poses	O
any	O
threat	O
wherever	O
he	O
is	O
.	O

If	O
he	O
is	O
alive	O
obviously	O
he	O
does	O
n't	O
pose	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
threat	O
that	O
an	O
Osama	O
bin	O

does	O
with	O
his	O

network	O
around	O
the	O
world	O
to	O
reactivate	O
al	O

So	O
it	O
would	O
certainly	O
be	O
good	O
to	O
know	O
where	O
he	O
is	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
certainly	O
to	O
know	O
to	O
apprehend	Arrest-Jail
him	O
to	O
bring	Charge-Indict
him	O
before	O
a	O
court	O
of	O

But	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
absolutely	O
critical	O
for	O
the	O

MCCHRYSTAL	O

It	O
looks	O
and	O

what	O
it	O
requires	O

activities	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
prepared	O
and	O
do	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
but	O
clearly	O
when	O
you	O
see	O
a	O
tactic	O

this	O
it	O
requires	O
strict	O

during	O

For	O

before	O

I	O

at	O

was	O
trying	O

to	O
solve	O
this	O

and	O
I	O
believe	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
if	O
you	O
remember	O
um	O
Yasser	O
Arafat	O
--	O
and	O
uh	O
the	O
prime	O
minister	O
of	O
Israel	O
his	O
name	O
was	O
Barak	O
they	O
met	Meet
together	O
in	O
the	O
White	O

--	O
and	O
--	O
they	O
almost	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
agreement	O
--	O
to	O
solve	O
this	O
problem	O
--	O
and	O
during	O
Clinton	O
eh	O
period	O
--	O
they	O
had	O
uh	O
this	O
-LRB-	O
-LRB-	O
Oslo	O
-RRB-	O
-RRB-	O
a	O
eh	O
agreement	O

Most	O

the	O

between	O
the	O

they	O

everything	O
almost	O

there	O

there	O
were	O

final	O
steps	O
that	O
have	O
to	O
be	O

But	O
uh	O
I	O
think	O
if	O
there	O

the	O
um	O
the	O

to	O
be	O
followed	O

I	O

everything	O

then	O
--	O
the	O
--	O
I	O

went	O

Well	O
that	O
's	O
an	O
interesting	O
question	O
they	O

Paul	O

Yeah	O
it	O
is	O
uh	O
the	O
past	O
couple	O
of	O
topics	O
have	O
been	O
--	O
more	O
controversial	O
than	O
--	O
the	O
early	O
topics	O
--	O
and	O
uh	O
well	O
I	O
'm	O
I	O
'm	O
very	O
opinionated	O
.	O

I	O
'm	O
happy	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

Rainia	O

Yeah	O
go	O
right	O
ahead	O
.	O

Paul	O

Well	O
um	O
Yasser	O
Arafat	O
was	O
--	O
was	O
he	O
a	O
good	O
leader	O
?	O

I	O
I	O
think	O
--	O
that	O
uh	O
he	O
--	O
he	O
's	O
--	O
pretty	O
much	O
--	O
--	O
or	O
he	O
was	O
pretty	O
much	O
--	O
following	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
always	O
done	O
even	O
as	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
uh	O
back	O
in	O
Algeria	O
--	O
when	O
when	O
he	O
led	O
the	O
--	O
terrorist	O
attacks	Attack
against	O
the	O
French	O
to	O
kick	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
--	O
Algeria	O
.	O

And	O
I	O
I	O
think	O
he	O
was	O
doing	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
there	O
in	O
Palestine	O
.	O

I	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
eh	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
he	O
really	O
knew	O
how	O
to	O
uh	O
take	O
on	O
the	O
role	O
of	O
of	O
peacemaker	O
.	O

You	O
know	O
I	O
'm	O
I	O
'm	O
--	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
could	O
be	O
wrong	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
just	O
my	O
opinion	O
.	O

But	O
i	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
that	O
that	O
was	O
always	O
a	O
problem	O
for	O
him	O
.	O

Hm	O
.	O

Rainia	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Um	O
I	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
myself	O
uh	O
how	O
good	O
a	O
leader	O
he	O
was	O
.	O

I	O
I	O
--	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
truth	O
w	O
when	O
the	O
--	O
when	O
the	O
there	O
's	O
so	O
many	O
uh	O

uh	O

Paul	O

Yeah	O

especially	O
on	O
the	O
main	O

.	O

Paul	O

That	O
's	O
true	O

Rainia	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
--	O
like	O
the	O
way	O
--	O
Israel	O
has	O
been	O
--	O
going	O
after	O
the	O
Palestinians	O

Paul	O

Right	O
.	O

I	O
I	O
agree	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
Ariel	O
Sharon	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
like	O
Yasser	O
Arafat	O
.	O

And	O
I	O
--	O
ca	O
n't	O

why	O
the	O
two	O
of	O
them	O

did	O

Um	O

the	O

?	O

Paul	O

Yeah	O

That	O
that	O
's	O

because	O

cutting	O
Yasser	O

was	O
really	O

's	O

I	O
think	O
--	O
personally	O
he	O
did	O

him	O
because	O
he	O
thought	O
he	O
was	O

a	O

he	O
refused	O

I	O
'm	O

when	O
they	O
had	O
uh	O
--	O
it	O
had	O
happened	O
because	O

then	O
they	O
had	O

they	O
found	O
the	O

as	O
well	O

Irvin	O

Terrible	O
.	O

Winnette	O

Um	O
so	O
when	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
baby	O
the	O
baby	O
of	O
course	O
had	O
been	O
--	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
the	O
baby	O
was	O
born	Be-Born
through	O
delivery	O
or	O
--	O
if	O
maybe	O
from	O
um	O
--	O
the	O
corpse	O
I	O
guess	O

Irvin	O

So	O
the	O
baby	O
was	O
separate	O
.	O

Winnette	O

maybe	O
extracted	O
it	O
.	O

Um	O
actually	O
she	O
was	O
pregnant	O
for	O
the	O
baby	O
.	O

Irvin	O

But	O
the	O
baby	O
was	O
separate	O
from	O
the	O
body	O
when	O
he	O
found	O
it	O
?	O

Winnette	O

Yes	O
.	O

Yep	O
.	O

Um	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
ma	O
I	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
the	O
whole	O
story	O
for	O
sure	O
but	O
--	O
um	O
--	O
he	O
had	O
--	O
you	O
know	O
obviously	O
--	O
denied	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
involved	O
anything	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

Then	O
they	O
found	O
out	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
having	O
an	O
affair	O
on	O
her	O
.	O

And	O
--	O
then	O
of	O
course	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
investigating	O
him	O
--	O
he	O
tried	O
running	O
.	O

Dyed	O
his	O
hair	O
and	O
--	O
grew	O
out	O
a	O
mustache	O
and	O
--	O
they	O
caught	O
him	O
trying	O
to	O
run	O
with	O
--	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
cash	O
.	O

Irvin	O

-LRB-	O
-LRB-	O
-RRB-	O
-RRB-	O

Winnette	O

he	O
's	O
--	O
in	O
all	O

been	O

all	O
along	O
the	O
way	O
but	O

Irvin	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Winnette	O

of	O
course	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
've	O
got	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
that	O
reasonable	O
doubt	O
.	O

Irvin	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
is	O
he	O
is	O
he	O
still	O
um	O
--	O
in	O
prison	O
now	O
?	O

Winnette	O

Yeah	O
.	O

And	O
they	O
're	O
making	O
the	O
determination	O
if	O
--	O
in	O
fact	O
he	O
will	O
get	Sentence
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
or	O
life	O
in	O
prison	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
's	O
is	O
up	O
in	O
the	O

right	O
now	O
.	O

Irvin	O

What	O
state	O
is	O
this	O
in	O
?	O

Winnette	O

California	O
.	O

Irvin	O

It	O
's	O
in	O
California	O
.	O

Winnette	O

And	O
--	O
um	O
--	O
I	O
know	O
I	O
had	O
it	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
be	O
deliberated	O
on	O
--	O
the	O
twenty-second	O
of	O
November	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
an	O
issue	O
happen	O
with	O
--	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
jurors	O
--	O
so	O
it	O
's	O
postponed	O
everything	O
.	O

But	O
actually	O
they	O
were	O
trying	O
to	O
pass	O
a	O
law	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
ever	O
did	O
take	O
into	O
effect	O
that	O
if	O
in	O
fact	O
a	O
mother	O
was	O
killed	Die
and	O
pregnant	O
um	O
--	O
for	O
there	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
double	O
murder	O
charge	Charge-Indict
.	O

Irvin	O

Oh	O
uh-huh	O
.	O

Winnette	O

And	O
--	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
fact	O
trying	O
to	O
enforce	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
on	O
that	O
charge	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
--	O
found	Convict
guilty	O
on	O
both	O
charges	O
.	O

Irvin	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Winnette	O

And	O
--	O
so	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
now	O
--	O
because	O
he	O
--	O
I	O
believe	O
he	O
got	Convict
first	O
degree	O
murder	O
and	O
--	O
um	O
and	O
then	O
got	Convict
manslaughter	O
on	O
the	O
baby	O
.	O

So	O
he	O
did	O
n't	O
get	Convict
both	O
first	O
degree	O
murders	O
.	O

Irvin	O

What	O
's	O
the	O
difference	O
?	O

Winnette	O

Where	O
--	O
Um	O
I	O
guess	O
because	O
he	O
did	O
n't	O
murder	Die
the	O
baby	O
directly	O
.	O

Irvin	O

Oh	O
.	O

Winnette	O

I	O
'm	O
thinking	O
maybe	O
was	O
the	O
difference	O
.	O

And	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
the	O
charge	Charge-Indict
on	O
the	O
baby	O
they	O
could	O
n't	O
automatically	O
give	Sentence
him	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
but	O
--	O
obviously	O
there	O
's	O
enough	O
--	O
um	O
complaints	O
or	O
whatever	O

Irvin	O

What	O
was	O
his	O
excuse	O
for	O
doing	O

BEGALA	O

Mr.	O
King	O
thanks	O
for	O
stying	O
with	O
us	O
through	O
the	O
break	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
that	O
we	O
like	O
having	O
you	O
on	O
and	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
Mr.	O

is	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
this	O
is	O
war	Attack
as	O
we	O
were	O
saying	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
segment	O
.	O

You	O
treat	O
it	Attack
with	O
the	O
gravity	O
and	O
the	O
seriousness	O
that	O
it	Attack
deserves	O
.	O

And	O
you	O
're	O
a	O
congressman	O
who	O
has	O
put	O
his	O
constituents	O
and	O
his	O
country	O
ahead	O
of	O
his	O
partisan	O

So	O
I	O
wonder	O
if	O
you	O
'll	O
join	O
Charlie	O

who	O
put	O
out	O
a	O
press	O

today	O
decrying	O
the	O

to	O

wrong	O

KING	O

The	O
important	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
bill	O
pass	O
for	O
the	O
military	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
other	O
stuff	O
's	O
in	O
there	O
it	O
's	O
there	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
main	O
purpose	O
should	O
be	O
the	O
military	O

I	O
'm	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
disagree	O
with	O

point	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
often	O
when	O
bills	O
are	O
passed	O
there	O
are	O
things	O
attached	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

So	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
key	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
that	O

the	O

interesting	O
but	O
they	O
've	O
been	O
having	O
this	O
one	O
for	O
three	O
days	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
why	O
they	O
're	O
so	O
obsessed	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

Mohammed	O

Seems	O
like	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
weekend	O
or	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
they	O
can	O
feedback	O
from	O
people	O
.	O

Jean	O

I	O
guess	O
so	O
Yes	O
.	O

Mohammed	O

And	O
so	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
was	O

Jean	O

I	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
actually	O
--	O
watch	O
the	O
trial	Trial-Hearing
very	O
much	O
uh	O
th	O
in	O
fact	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
watch	O
the	O
trial	Trial-Hearing
at	O
all	O
.	O

Mohammed	O

Mhm	O
.	O

Jean	O

I	O
read	O
about	O
it	Trial-Hearing
in	O
the	O
newspaper	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
.	O

Um	O
I	O
do	O
think	O
from	O
all	O
the	O
uh	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
that	O
he	O
--	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
guilty	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
evidence	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
but	O
um	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
know	O
why	O
uh	O
if	O
everybody	O
was	O
so	O
sort	O
of	O
obsessed	O
about	O
it	O
when	O
we	O
've	O
got	O
so	O
much	O
other	O
--	O
things	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
that	O
uh	O
seem	O
to	O
me	O
much	O
more	O
important	O
but	O
um	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
it	O
was	O
because	O
he	O
seemed	O
uh	O
a	O
very	O
human	O
kind	O
of	O
person	O
and	O
and	O
you	O
cou	O
you	O
could	O
n't	O
really	O
understand	O
why	O
he	O
would	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
about	O
that	O
.	O

I	O
I	O
think	O
his	O
motive	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
be	O
with	O
his	O
new	O
girlfriend	O
but	O
uh	O
--	O
kill	Die
his	O
own	O
first	O

that	O
way	O
is	O
extraordinary	O

What	O
do	O
you	O

?	O

Mohamed	O
?	O

Mohammed	O

Yeah	O

And	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
What	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
about	O
it	O
?	O

Mohammed	O

Being	O
very	O
frankly	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
uh	O
following	O
the	O

at	O
all	O
even	O
uh	O
uh	O

uh	O

from	O
what	O
I	O
can	O
observe	O
that	O
it	O
seems	O
eh	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
talking	O

you	O
what	O

it	O

really	O
a	O

I	O
'm	O
asking	O
myself	O
why	O
it	O
took	O
such	O
a	O
long	O

Jean	O

Hm	O
.	O

Mohammed	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
because	O
--	O
it	O
's	O
quite	O

so	O
there	O
is	O
so	O
many	O
everything	O
's	O
I	O

's	O
it	O

or	O
not	O
?	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O

a	O
very	O
good	O
uh	O
I	O

uh	O
way	O
to	O
give	O

all	O
the	O

they	O

I	O

that	O
