I	O

we	O
're	O
seeing	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
advantages	O
of	O
U.S.	O

British	O
forces	O
now	O
Judy	O
which	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
superbly	O

They	O
have	O
training	O
in	O
a	O
whole	O
variety	O
of	O
different	O
missions	O
and	O
they	O
're	O

They	O
recognize	O
now	O
they	O
went	O

with	O
some	O
false	O

about	O
the	O

that	O
they	O
were	O
going	O

The	O

in	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
're	O
likely	O
to	O
see	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
Iraqis	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
tougher	O
time	O
adapting	O
than	O
U.S.	O
forces	O
are	O
.	O

Typically	O
what	O
you	O
've	O
seen	O
in	O
the	O
Iraqi	O
armed	O
forces	O
is	O
the	O
change	O
has	O
to	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
top	O
.	O

It	O
does	O
n't	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
ground	O
up	O
.	O

You	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
ground	O
commanders	O
calling	O
back	O
and	O
saying	O
hey	O
we	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
try	O
this	O
tactic	O
or	O
this	O
seems	O
to	O
work	O
.	O

Tell	O
everybody	O
else	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
.	O

Instead	O
the	O
high	O
command	O
has	O
to	O
identify	O
a	O
problem	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
solution	O
and	O
transmit	O
it	O
down	O
.	O

Chances	O
are	O
the	O
Iraqis	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
continue	O
to	O
stick	O
with	O
what	O
we	O
've	O
seen	O
before	O
irregular	O
forces	O
blending	O
in	O
with	O
civilians	O
trying	O

are	O

All	O
right	O

Well	O
this	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
we	O
've	O
been	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
grip	O
on	O
for	O
years	O
exactly	O
what	O
the	O
Iraqi	O
people	O
feel	O
and	O
also	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
the	O
best	O
evidence	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
before	O
the	O
attack	Attack
began	O
was	O
that	O
Iraqis	O
do	O
they	O
despise	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
desperate	O
to	O
be	O
rid	End-Position
of	O
him	O
but	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
token	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
another	O
country	O
coming	O
into	O
their	O
country	O
to	O
overturn	O
the	O

and	O
beyond	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
probably	O
most	O
important	O
for	O
most	O
Iraqis	O
is	O
they	O
're	O
deeply	O
suspicious	O
of	O
the	O
United	O

They	O
remember	O
that	O
the	O
United	O

betrayed	O
them	O

1991	O

The	O
U.S.	O

that	O

if	O
it	O
's	O
true	O

we	O

know	O
just	O
yet	O
but	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
true	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
significant	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
effectively	O
the	O
Iraqis	O
admitting	O
that	O
many	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
we	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
is	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
armored	O

vehicles	O
there	O
in	O

and	O
we	O
will	O

them	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
great	O
question	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
animation	O
is	O
good	O
because	O
it	O
does	O
show	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
hide	O
literally	O
anywhere	O
in	O
a	O
city	O
environment	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
why	O
movement	O
through	O
an	O
urban	O

is	O
very	O
very	O
dangerous	O

It	O
's	O
the	O
side	O
that	O
's	O
moving	O
that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
take	O
the	O

That	O
said	O
the	O
armored	O

that	O
you	O
see	O
there	O
they	O
look	O
to	O
me	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
moving	Transport
a	O
little	O

faster	O

than	O
we	O
probably	O
will	O

We	O
'll	O
use	O

We	O
will	O
take	O
the	O

to	O

the	O

surround	O
the	O
blocks	O
and	O
the	O
buildings	O
that	O
he	O

in	O

And	O
then	O
we	O
'll	O
probably	O
surge	Attack

into	O
their	O
both	O
lethal	O
and	O
nonlethal	O
to	O
make	O
his	O

go	O
in	O

is	O
generally	O
the	O

if	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
to	O
go	O

the	O
top	O

down	O

One	O
of	O
the	O

The	O

have	O
released	O
the	O

and	O
realigned	O
all	O
the	O
disks	O
and	O
put	O
plates	O
and	O
stuff	O
in	O
it	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
because	O
she	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
feeling	O
in	O
her	O

.	O

So	O
he	O
he	O

that	O
that	O

relieve	O

D.	O
LYNCH	O

We	O

to	O

the	O

I	O

and	O
she	O
's	O
just	O
she	O
just	O
sounded	O

Of	O
course	O
this	O
morning	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
groggy	O

But	O
yet	O
she	O
was	O
good	O

it	O
was	O
early	O
.	O

And	O
then	O
this	O
afternoon	O
after	O
the	O

she	O
was	O

Jessie	O

QUESTION	O

If	O
those	O
were	O
n't	O
gunshot	O
wounds	Injure
to	O
cause	O
the	O
broken	O
bones	O
do	O
they	O

the	O

?	O

G.	O
LYNCH	O

They	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
what	O
caused	O
them	Injure
.	O

We	O
know	O
she	O
's	O
in	O
good	O
spirits	O
because	O
they	O
told	O
her	O
they	O
was	O
gon	O
na	O
put	O
pink	O
casts	O
on	O
her	O
legs	O
and	O
arms	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
pink	O
casts	O
when	O
she	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
third	O
grade	O
on	O
her	O
arm	O
so	O
we	O
know	O
she	O
--	O
her	O
mind	O
is	O
working	O
good	O
.	O

So	O
she	O
's	O
in	O
good	O

and	O
we	O
hope	O
the	O
surgery	O
will	O
go	O

what	O

that	O

What	O
's	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
?	O

In	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
1991	O
the	O
task	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
and	O
get	O
them	O
out	O

In	O
this	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O

It	O
was	O
to	O

Bob	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
I	O
think	O
so	O
many	O
Americans	O
are	O
worried	O
about	O
this	O
war	Attack
and	O
so	O
many	O
people	O
around	O
the	O
world	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
is	O
there	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
problems	O
with	O
credibility	O
from	O
this	O
administration	O
.	O

Our	O
president	O
has	O
repeatedly	O
for	O
example	O
relied	O
on	O
a	O
man	O
whom	O
you	O
're	O
aware	O
Hussein	O
Kamel	O
Saddam	O
Hussein	O
's	O
son-in-law	O
leader	O
of	O
the	O
Iraq	O
arms	O
program	O
who	O
defected	O
for	O
a	O
time	O
.	O

And	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
whole	O
lot	O
of	O
information	O
and	O
then	O
went	Transport
home	O
and	O
his	O
father-in-law	O
killed	Die

Bad	O

But	O

whole	O

Well	O
our	O

told	O
us	O
that	O
information	O
proves	O
that	O
the	O
dictator	O
had	O
chemical	O
weapons	O
which	O
is	O
true	O
.	O

But	O
what	O
we	O
just	O
learned	O
this	O

from	O
``	O

which	O
got	O

that	O
he	O
also	O
told	O

it	O
was	O
destroyed	O
back	O

Why	O
has	O

You	O
can	O

one	O
needs	O
to	O
break	O
down	O
this	O

into	O
various	O
elements	O

Today	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
an	O
authority	O

And	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
likely	O
that	O
the	O
U.S.	O
and	O
the	O
British	O

are	O
the	O

on	O

there	O

And	O
this	O

primarily	O
by	O
Iraqis	O

But	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O

I	O

we	O
really	O
need	O
to	O
map	O

how	O
to	O
move	O
from	O
this	O

it	O

one	O

's	O
totally	O
another	O

must	O
not	O
be	O
drawn	O
in	O
thin	O

out	O

must	O

there	O
are	O

It	O
's	O
not	O
a	O

It	O

not	O
a	O

And	O
I	O

must	O

there	O
in	O

in	O
its	O

one	O

can	O

everybody	O

you	O

first	O
of	O
all	O
we	O
were	O
--	O
when	O
Franklin	O

was	O
elected	Elect

we	O
had	O
been	O
living	O
what	O
we	O
thought	O
was	O
still	O
a	O
conquered	O
nation	O
after	O
the	O
Civil	Attack

And	O
we	O
felt	O
that	O
Franklin	O
Roosevelt	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
person	O
who	O
ever	O
really	O
acknowledged	O
that	O
the	O
South	O
had	O
peculiar	O
problems	O

And	O
from	O
that	O
time	O
on	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
reason	O
we	O
had	O
22	O
Democratic	O
senators	O
from	O
11	O
confederate	O
states	O
is	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
Civil	Attack
War	Attack
and	O
because	O
of	O
what	O
we	O
thought	O
was	O
a	O
heavy	O
hand	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

Of	O

there	O
was	O
always	O
that	O
old	O
story	O
about	O
the	O
Yankees	O
and	O
Yankees	O
were	O
synonymous	O
with	O

But	O
that	O
's	O
all	O
changed	O
and	O
memories	O
have	O
dimmed	O

And	O
people	O
you	O

they	O

And	O
so	O
the	O

the	O

have	O
actually	O
had	O
a	O

opportunity	O
to	O
make	O
their	O

and	O
they	O

it	O

And	O
the	O

need	O

to	O
get	O
a	O

to	O

they	O

Well	O
I	O
was	O
heartened	O
by	O
what	O
Secretary	O

told	O
you	O
in	O
the	O
last	O

that	O
we	O
will	O
have	O
troops	O
there	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
necessary	O
but	O
no	O
longer	O
than	O
necessary	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
way	O
to	O
state	O
it	O
.	O

My	O
own	O
view	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
security	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
clearly	O
is	O
our	O
responsibility	O
presently	O
.	O

We	O
are	O
trying	O
to	O
pass	O
that	O
on	O
to	O
others	O
.	O

Likewise	O
the	O
other	O

's	O
procedures	O
the	O
fledgling	O
beginnings	O
on	O
democracy	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
require	O
an	O
undergirding	O
.	O

Now	O
in	O
due	O
course	O
as	O
everybody	O
points	O
out	O
we	O
may	O
get	O
help	O
from	O

We	O
may	O

the	O
United	O

or	O
other	O

in	O
the	O

That	O
would	O
be	O
helpful	O
.	O

But	O
for	O
the	O
moment	O
this	O
is	O
our	O
responsibility	O
.	O

And	O
we	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
having	O
large	O
debates	O
about	O
how	O
rapidly	O
we	O
move	O
out	O

And	O
I	O
was	O
upset	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
hear	O
reports	O
that	O
by	O
the	O
fall	O
three	O
divisions	O
out	O
of	O
five	O

be	O

I	O
think	O

BLITZER	O

And	O
what	O
about	O

Senator	O

not	O
only	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
time	O
but	O
the	O
cost	O
to	O
U.S.	O
taxpayers	O
?	O

Have	O
you	O
been	O
given	O
any	O
ballpark	O
estimate	O
what	O
this	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
cost	O
the	O
United	O

DODD	O

No	O

Well	O
what	O
we	O
've	O
heard	O
the	O
numbers	O
of	O
reconstruction	O
running	O
around	O
100	O

We	O
put	O
2.5	O
billion	O
in	O
in	O
the	O

supplemental	O

So	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
costly	O
.	O

These	O
RFPs	O
these	O
seeking	O
bids	O
on	O
various	O

are	O
rather	O
costly	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
expensive	O
.	O

And	O
clearly	O
the	O
responsibility	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
fall	O
principally	O
on	O
the	O
United	O

Now	O
I	O
would	O
hope	O
that	O
sooner	O
rather	O
than	O
later	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
a	O

a	O

It	O

because	O

It	O
ought	O
to	O

pretty	O

that	O
it	O

be	O
entirely	O
contrary	O

for	O
an	O
active	O

to	O
be	Transfer-Money
money	O
after	O
leaving	End-Position

Suppose	O
for	O

were	O

that	O

10,000	O
upon	O
the	O

this	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
transparent	O
attempt	O
to	O
evade	O
the	O

and	O
would	O
fail	O

If	O
the	O

can	O

it	O

clearly	O
an	O

clearly	O
a	O

of	O

you	O

it	O

the	O
likelihood	O
that	O
someone	O
would	O
be	O
tempted	O
to	O
violate	O
the	O

by	O
the	O

that	O
then	O
the	O
remaining	O

could	O
for	O
good	O
reason	O

taken	O
place	O
while	O
Marinello	O
is	O
serving	O
as	O
President	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
conceivable	O
that	O
the	O
other	O
six	O
have	O
all	O
gotten	O
together	O
in	O
Marinello	O
's	O
absence	O
and	O
drafted	Start-Position
her	O
but	O
it	O
also	O
seems	O
pretty	O
clear	O
that	O
she	O
has	O
agreed	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
and	O
if	O
all	O
the	O
rumors	O
are	O
true	O
and	O
she	O
steps	End-Position
down	End-Position
it	O
will	O
be	O
so	O
that	O
she	O
can	O
take	O
on	O
these	O
new	O
responsibilities	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
`	O
time	O
limit	O
'	O
issue	O
does	O
n't	O
even	O
come	O
up	O
.	O

We	O
pretty	O
much	O
know	O
that	O
Marinello	O
while	O
on	O
the	O
board	O
has	O
arranged	O
to	O
get	Transfer-Money
future	O
money	O
from	O
the	O
USCF	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
already	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
.	O

If	O
this	O
is	O
NOT	O
a	O
problem	O
I	O
wish	O
someone	O
would	O
explain	O
to	O
me	O
why	O
not	O
.	O

Now	O
Stan	O
B.	O
argues	O
that	O
Marinello	O
's	O
services	O
are	O
in	O
fact	O
indispensible	O
as	O
move	O
coordinator	O
and	O
that	O
ethics	O
standards	O
are	O
not	O
a	O
suicide	O
pact	O
so	O
that	O
since	O
we	O
absolutely	O
NEED	O
her	O
the	O
EB	O
has	O
the	O
right	O
to	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
retain	O
her	O
.	O

I	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
principle	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
to	O
make	O
this	O
argument	O
work	O
the	O
EB	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
produce	O
some	O
evidence	O
that	O
Marinello	O
really	O
IS	O
indispensible	O
for	O
this	O
task	O
.	O

This	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
include	O
evidence	O
that	O
the	O
EB	O
had	O
considered	O
all	O
the	O
alternatives	O
including	O

delegating	O
the	O
whole	O
thing	O
to	O
the	O
Interim	O
ED	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
normal	O
practice	O
in	O
normal	O
organizations	O
with	O
an	O
ED	O

asking	O
the	O
Interim	O
ED	O
to	O
designate	Start-Position
someone	O
from	O
the	O
New	O
Windsor	O
staff	O
to	O
act	O
as	O
move	O
coordinator	O

asking	O
the	O
Interim	O
ED	O
to	O
hire	Start-Position
some	O
other	O
consultant	O
with	O
experience	O
in	O
office	O
relocation	O
to	O
manage	O
the	O
job	O
-LRB-	O
there	O
are	O
such	O
people	O
-RRB-	O

conducting	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
actual	O
search	O
for	O
candidates	O
for	O
the	O
position	O
during	O
the	O
last	O
two	O
months	O
since	O
the	O
move	O
was	O
decided	O
upon	O

If	O
they	O
did	O
consider	O
alternatives	O
it	O
would	O
also	O
have	O
to	O
include	O
evidence	O
that	O
Marinello	O
has	O
much	O
more	O
experience	O
at	O
relocating	O
offices	O
than	O
other	O
people	O
or	O
is	O
willing	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
job	O
cheaper	O
-LRB-	O
although	O
this	O
would	O
n't	O
constitute	O
being	O
``	O
indispensible	O
''	O
in	O
my	O
view	O
-RRB-	O
.	O

If	O
however	O
they	O
just	O
looked	O
around	O
the	O
room	O
and	O
said	O
``	O
who	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
manage	O
this	O
?	O

''	O
and	O
someone	O
said	O
``	O
Beatriz	O
how	O
about	O
you	O
?	O

''	O
this	O
does	O
not	O
constitute	O
proof	O
that	O
her	O
services	O
are	O
indispensible	O
and	O
thus	O
it	O
would	O
n't	O
interfere	O
with	O
my	O
belief	O
that	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
an	O
ethics	O
violation	O
and	O
a	O
bylaws	O
violation	O
.	O

One	O
very	O
bad	O
argument	O
that	O
was	O
made	O
by	O
Kevin	O
Bachler	O
which	O
to	O
be	O
fair	O
was	O
surrounded	O
by	O
arguably	O
better	O
ones	O
was	O
that	O
since	O
this	O
board	O
was	O
elected	Elect
we	O
should	O
let	O
them	O
do	O
as	O
they	O
please	O
.	O

Which	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
there	O
might	O
as	O
well	O
not	O
be	O
bylaws	O
ethics	O
standards	O
laws	O
etc.	O
since	O
an	O
elected	O
board	O
is	O
not	O
bound	O
by	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
idea	O
should	O
be	O
rejected	O
.	O

Another	O
argument	O
which	O
is	O
better	O
but	O
still	O
disturbing	O
is	O
that	O
yes	O
this	O
is	O
an	O
ethics	O
violation	O
and	O
maybe	O
worse	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
only	O
hurt	O
the	O
USCF	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
it	O
and	O
that	O
only	O
troublemakers	O
like	O
Sam	O
Sloan	O
Larry	O
Parr	O
and	O
I	O
suppose	O
me	O
would	O
talk	O
about	O
it	O
since	O
doing	O
so	O
will	O
obstruct	O
the	O
federation	O
's	O
plans	O
cause	O
us	O
to	O
pay	O
legal	O
expenses	O
run	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
our	O
being	O
stuck	O
without	O
any	O
office	O
space	O
at	O
all	O
cause	O
people	O
not	O
to	O
loan	Transfer-Money
us	O
money	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
should	O
all	O
ignore	O
this	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
realistic	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
.	O

I	O
'm	O
not	O
entirely	O
unsympathetic	O
to	O
this	O
actually	O
.	O

But	O
frankly	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
a	O
whole	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
problems	O
the	O
USCF	O
has	O
had	O
over	O
the	O
years	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
well-intentioned	O
people	O
keeping	O
secrets	O
because	O
bringing	O
them	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
open	O
would	O
harm	O
the	O
USCF	O
and	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
we	O
have	O
awful	O
habits	O
which	O
hurt	O
the	O
USCF	O
even	O
worse	O
.	O

But	O
if	O
we	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
realism	O
here	O
is	O
another	O
realistic	O
concern	O
I	O
predict	O
that	O
if	O
in	O
fact	O
the	O
rumors	O
about	O
the	O
agenda	O
for	O
the	O
Florida	O
meeting	Meet
prove	O
true	O
and	O
Marinello	O
resigns	End-Position
as	O
President	O
and	O
is	O
hired	Start-Position
as	O
move	O
coordinator	O
the	O
immediate	O
result	O
of	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
Sam	O
Sloan	O
will	O
file	O
another	O
lawsuit	Sue
-LRB-	O
or	O
amend	O
his	O
current	O

with	O

This	O
is	O
not	O

on	O
any	O

this	O

a	O
cop-out	O
response	O

the	O
reason	O
we	O
are	O
so	O

is	O
because	O
we	O
are	O
on	O
a	O
higher	O
level	O
than	O
90	O
of	O
the	O

because	O
we	O

if	O
countries	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
start	O
developing	O
nuclear	O
weapons-grade	O
material	O
it	O
makes	O
us	O

although	O
so	O

iran	O
has	O
shown	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
producing	O
weapons-grade	O
material	O
and	O
are	O
in	O

using	O
their	O
nuclear	O
power	O
for	O
just	O
that	O
according	O

when	O
you	O

has	O
an	O
infatuation	O
with	O

you	O
can	O

everything	O
he	O
can	O

to	O
prove	O
his	O

is	O
a	O
much	O
bigger	O

So	O
far	O
it	O

from	O

a	O

on	O
the	O
Carnival	O

There	O
two	O
main	O
qualities	O
to	O
be	O
desired	O
in	O
a	O
Commander-in-Chief	O
Generalship	O
and	O
Leadership	O
.	O

Because	O
in	O
the	O
United	O
States	O
the	O
Commander-in-Chief	O
is	O
a	O
purely	O
political	O
post	O
generalship	O
is	O
usually	O
undertaken	O
by	O
the	O
generals	O
proper	O
under	O
the	O
Commander-in-Chief	O
provided	O
it	O
is	O
understood	O
that	O
the	O
Commander-in-Chief	O
is	O
ultimately	O
responsible	O
and	O
accountable	O
for	O
the	O
outcomes	O
of	O
his	O
general	O
's	O
generalship	O
.	O

Generalship	O
involves	O
the	O
technical	O
skills	O
of	O
intelligence	O
gathering	O
strategic	O
and	O
tactical	O
planning	O
and	O
the	O
communication	O
of	O
orders	O

Leadership	O
can	O
be	O
less	O
rigidly	O
defined	O
and	O
is	O
concerned	O
less	O
with	O
coordination	O
than	O
motivation	O
and	O
how	O
a	O
commander	O
seeks	O
to	O
inspire	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
fight	Attack
harder	O
and	O
endure	O
worse	O
privations	O
in	O

President	O
Bush	O
generalship	O
has	O
proven	O
deficient	O

His	O
planning	O
for	O
the	O
war	Attack
was	O
inadequate	O
and	O
his	O
monitoring	O
of	O
the	O

The	O
Commander-in-Chief	O
's	O
generalship	O
can	O
suffice	O
to	O
motivate	O
men	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
higly	O
confident	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
capable	O

Thanks	O
in	O

to	O
the	O
NCA	O
the	O

However	O
this	O
new	O
and	O

on	O
these	O

also	O
had	O
the	O

Some	O
collectors	O
of	O

The	O
increasing	O

between	O

an	O

The	O

that	O

in	O

For	O
the	O

If	O
your	O

it	O
is	O
generally	O
considered	O
to	O
be	O
inappropriate	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
jurisdictions	O
it	O
is	O
illegal	O
to	O
compensate	Transfer-Money

You	O
should	O
check	O
out	O
the	O

in	O
your	O

It	O

OverDrive	O
with	O
an	O

Then	O
Intel	O

the	O

the	O

So	O
the	O
lawyers	O
sued	Sue
Gateway	O

the	O
settlement	O
approved	O

consisted	O

The	O

that	O

not	O

I	O

what	O

All	O
I	O

that	O

what	O
's	O
better	O
is	O
that	O
Auburn	O
gets	O
to	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
hottest	O
teams	O
in	O
the	O

in	O
my	O

I	O

it	O

It	O
would	O

to	O

about	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
separate	O

be	O

I	O
know	O

duality	O
is	O
a	O
popular	O
cause	O
for	O

However	O
there	O
is	O
little	O
empirical	O
evidence	O
to	O
suggest	O
that	O
separating	O
these	O
roles	O
affects	O

performance	O
in	O
either	O
a	O
positive	O
or	O
negative	O
way	O

Having	O
a	O
combined	O
CEO/Chairman	O
does	O
reduce	O
the	O
ability	O
of	O
the	O
board	O
to	O
act	O
as	O
a	O
check	O
on	O

and	O
this	O
does	O
mean	O
that	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
critical	O

of	O
the	O

has	O
one	O

defenses	O
in	O
the	O

were	O

number	O
one	O

in	O

two	O

The	O

Alabama	O
simply	O
can	O

is	O
a	O
good	O
thing	O
because	O

's	O

the	O

for	O
them	O
with	O
no	O

In	O
1994	O
I	O
was	O
a	O

I	O
was	O

for	O
a	O

at	O

The	O

was	O
being	O
held	O
by	O
a	O
new	O

I	O
expected	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
small	O
gathering	O
of	O
idealistic	O
slightly	O
naive	O

What	O
I	O
found	O
was	O
a	O
packed	O
room	O
of	O
200	O
intelligent	O

that	O

a	O

Recently	O

A	O
little	O

of	O

is	O
that	O

that	O

will	O

the	O
vast	O

that	O

However	O
my	O
organizational	O

reveals	O
a	O
very	O

level	O
of	O

This	O
may	O
partially	O
justify	O
a	O

A	O

Its	O
weakest	O
score	O
is	O
in	O
the	O

In	O
the	O
past	O
several	O
observers	O
have	O
raised	O
concerns	O
about	O
aggressive	O
accounting	O
at	O
Starbucks	O
but	O
my	O
analysis	O
does	O
not	O
indicate	O
any	O
systematic	O
current	O
issues	O
.	O

The	O
weak	O
score	O
is	O
primarily	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
Starbucks	O
current	O
strategy	O
of	O
increasing	O
equity	O
ownership	O
of	O
several	O
foreign	O
subsidiaries	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
strategic	O
shift	O
that	O
has	O
short-term	O
costs	O
and	O
adds	O
some	O
uncertainty	O
to	O
the	O

Beyond	O
the	O

Starbucks	O

little	O
debt	O
.	O

Starbucks	O
is	O
not	O
currently	O
financing	O
its	O
growth	O
with	O
debt	O
.	O

Considering	O
its	O
growth	O
this	O
is	O
amazing	O
.	O

It	O
also	O
means	O
that	O
Starbucks	O
has	O
a	O
large	O
amount	O
of	O
flexibility	O
in	O
how	O
it	O
finances	O
future	O
growth	O

The	O

can	O
assume	O

2	O
.	O

Starbucks	O
has	O
a	O
healthy	O
cashflow	O
and	O
current	O
cash	O
position	O
.	O

This	O
allows	O
the	O
company	O
to	O
grow	O
without	O

.	O

You	O
could	O
argue	O
that	O

has	O

much	O

and	O
should	O
do	O
more	O
to	O

This	O

Shaq	O
has	O
denied	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
beginning	O
but	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
really	O
the	O
point	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
no	O
secret	O
that	O
a	O
large	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
NBA	O
's	O
``	O
stars	O
''	O
are	O
not	O
exactly	O
star-worthy	O

Good	O

guys	O
like	O
Kemp	O

Bryant	O
and	O
Iverson	O

the	O
entire	O

team	O

just	O
not	O
very	O
nice	O
or	O
good	O
people	O

If	O
the	O
league	O
will	O
tolerate	O
it	O
what	O

I	O

But	O
the	O
real	O

is	O
this	O

Kobe	O

on	O
...	O
that	O
's	O
right	O

December	O
25th	O

So	O
the	O
real	O
motivation	O
for	O
Kobe	O
here	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
mend	O
fences	O
or	O
admit	O
he	O

to	O

any	O
other	O
person	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
little	O
pit	O

It	O
is	O
to	O
find	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
way	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
340-pound	O
Shaquille	O

out	O

I	O

tell	O
you	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
ways	O
that	O
Kobe	O

Despite	O
his	O

his	O
nice	O

he	O
's	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	O

a	O

a	O

I	O
hardly	O

refused	O

that	O

with	O

over	O

but	O
the	O
key	O
question	O
which	O

is	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
do	O
after	O

what	O
kind	O
of	O

do	O
you	O

?	O

there	O
's	O
no	O
proof	O

that	O
.	O

well	O
the	O
key	O
here	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
to	O

that	O
kind	O
of	O
legitimate	O

to	O
have	O
it	O
look	O
good	O

to	O
hold	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
hold	O

you	O
stop	O
the	O
whole	O

held	O

and	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
ethnic	O

get	O
into	O

because	O
they	O

Mike	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
he	O
was	O

I	O
think	O
he	O
was	O
just	O
fr	O

and	O
I	O
think	O
he	O
'd	O
been	O
uh	O
he	O
'd	O
been	O

and	O
he	O

Mike	O

presentation	O

so	O
forth	O
.	O

Paul	O

Right	O

Mike	O

And	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
whatever	O
it	O
was	O
it	O
got	O
him	O
just	O
caught	O
up	O
with	O
him	O
and	O
and	O
he	O
reached	O
the	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
his	O
time	O
.	O

Paul	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Mike	O

So	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
it	O
on	O
that	O
I	O
guess	O
.	O

Paul	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Well	O
I	O
I	O
guess	O
now	O
that	O
that	O
he	O
's	O
he	O
's	O
died	Die
--	O
it	O
'll	O
be	O
uh	O
or	O
it	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
change	O
for	O
the	O
~	O
PLO	O

Mike	O

Well	O
yeah	O
it	O
'll	O
be	O
change	O
.	O

I	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
'll	O
move	O
forward	O
any	O
better	O
--	O
but	O
uh	O
this	O
uh	O
I	O
've	O
heard	O
our	O
administration	O
thinks	O
it	O
will	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
block	O
to	O
the	O
peace	O
--	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
only	O
his	O
doing	O
it	O
's	O
also	O
the	O
--	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
uh	O
more	O
uh	O
drastic	O
elements	O
of	O
the	O
~	O
PLO	O
that	O
uh	O
that	O
uh	O
would	O
n't	O
allow	O
him	O
to	O
pursue	O
peace	O

Paul	O

Right	O
.	O

Mike	O

at	O
any	O
cost	O
.	O

Paul	O

Well	O
I	O
'm	O
--	O
I	O
'm	O
--	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
uh	O
.	O

He	O
he	O
seems	O
like	O
a	O
guy	O
who	O
is	O
much	O
more	O
comfortable	O
--	O
being	O
under	O
siege	Attack
than	O
in	O
negotiating	O
peace	O
settlements	O
.	O

Mike	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Paul	O

Um	O
I	O

Mike	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Paul	O

maybe	O
that	O

Mike	O

Well	O
you	O
know	O
he	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
damned	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
and	O
damned	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
n't	O
.	O

Paul	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Well	O

Mike	O

You	O
know	O
if	O
he	O
if	O
he	O
made	O
peace	O
he	O
had	O
factions	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
people	O
that	O
would	O
've	O
killed	Die
him	O
--	O
and	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
n't	O
make	O
peace	O
eh	O
then	O
he	O
's	O
considered	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
the	O
warmongering	O
uh	O
man	O
who	O
wo	O
n't	O
make	O
peace	O
you	O
know	O
.	O

So	O
he	O
uh	O
he	O
could	O
n't	O
really	O
win	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
he	O
could	O
make	O
peace	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
anyone	O
else	O
can	O
either	O
.	O

Paul	O

Yeah	O
I	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
big	O
question	O
if	O
someone	O
moderate	O
takes	O
over	O
and	O
they	O
reach	O
a	O
settlement	O
does	O
that	O
mean	O
the	O
~	O
PLO	O
will	O
split	O
?	O

I	O
mean	O
that	O
--	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
just	O
--	O
dangerous	O
.	O

Mike	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Paul	O

I	O
guess	O
uh	O
making	O
peace	O
with	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
Palestinians	O
is	O
better	O
than	O
nothing	O
.	O

Mike	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
questions	O
it	O
asked	O
us	O
was	O
did	O
we	O
think	O
our	O
president	O
and	O
our	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O

should	O
've	O
attended	O
his	O

you	O
think	O
about	O
that	O
?	O

Paul	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Well	O
I	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
remember	O
who	O
they	O
sent	O
but	O
they	O
did	O
send	Transport
over	O
some	O
very	O
--	O
low	O
level	O
state	O
department	O
person	O

Mike	O

Oh	O
I	O
see	O
.	O

Paul	O

and	O
uh	O

Mike	O

I	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
.	O

Paul	O

I	O
I	O
--	O
I	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
embarrassed	O
about	O
that	O
.	O

Mike	O

That	O
we	O
did	O
or	O
d	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
send	O
our	O
officials	O
.	O

Paul	O

I	O
mean	O
--	O
We	O
--	O
we	O
did	O
but	O
i	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
--	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
nobody	O
basically	O
.	O

Mike	O

So	O
you	O
were	O
embarrassed	O
because	O
you	O
thought	O
they	O
should	O
've	O
sent	O
someone	O
higher	O
up	O
?	O

someone	O
higher	O
up	O

Paul	O

And	O
uh	O
I	O

how	O
we	O
consider	O

Arafat	O
a	O

we	O
also	O
should	O

the	O

and	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
company	O
as	O
well	O
set	O
up	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
account	O
manager	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
--	O
the	O
vice	O
president	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
super	O
team	O
lead	O
team	O
leads	O
uh	O
I	O
and	O
then	O
have	O
operations	O
specialist	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
--	O
team	O
managers	O
training	O
managers	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
very	O
big	O
company	O
.	O

Yeah	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
atmosphere	O
is	O
very	O
good	O
I	O

Bill	O

Right	O
.	O

Alexander	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Bill	O

Well	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
important	O
to	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
good	O
atmosphere	O
and	O
also	O
uh	O
uh	O
i	O
know	O
who	O
who	O
really	O
is	O
in	O
charge	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
and	O
know	O
who	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
answer	O
to	O
.	O

Because	O
sometimes	O
y	O
I	O
I	O
I	O
did	O
I	O
years	O
ago	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
company	O
that	O
was	O
uh	O
it	O
was	O
uh	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
subs	O
s	O
captive	O
sub-contractor	O
for	O
making	O
packaging	O
material	O
.	O

And	O
um	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
salesmen	O
in	O
the	O
company	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
tendency	O
to	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
was	O
there	O
was	O
uh	O
a	O
chain	O
of	O
command	O
you	O
might	O
say	O
.	O

You	O
know	O
there	O
was	O
uh	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
uh	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
organization	O
.	O

But	O
all	O
the	O
salesmen	O
--	O
used	O
to	O
come	O
around	O
and	O
give	O
orders	O
too	O
you	O
know	O
.	O

So	O
it	O
made	O
it	O
kind	O
of	O
difficult	O
for	O
the	O
m	O
for	O
my	O
employees	O
because	O
they	O
would	O
the	O
salesmen	O
would	O
be	O
coming	O
out	O
uh	O
uh	O
without	O
consulting	O
with	O
the	O
one	O
that	O
was	O
in	O
charge	O
.	O

They	O
would	O
just	O
be	O
coming	O
out	O
and	O
giving	O
orders	O
when	O
they	O
should	O
already	O
went	O
through	O
him	O
.	O

So	O
it	O
made	O
it	O
difficult	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
I	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
important	O
to	O
h	O
have	O
that	O
really	O
clear	O
.	O

That	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
some	O
organized	O
way	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
uh	O
problems	O
and	O
orders	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
and	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
problem	O
then	O
--	O
you	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
's	O
in	O
charge	O
and	O
--	O
then	O
they	O
can	O
handle	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
was	O
--	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
--	O
previous	O
uh	O
type	O
of	O
work	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
.	O

And	O
I	O
and	O
tha	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
they	O
wanted	O
us	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
too	O
right	O
?	O

Alexander	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Yeah	O
that	O
's	O
that	O
's	O
that	O
's	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
basically	O
is	O
-LRB-	O

-RRB-	O
-RRB-	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
I	O
perceive	O
is	O
if	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
environment	O
is	O
it	O
and	O
is	O
it	O
inviting	O
is	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
all	O
that	O
they	O
I	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
aiming	O
at	O
.	O

You	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
a	O

and	O
everybody	O
trying	O
to	O

you	O

Uh	O
but	O
I	O
for	O
my	O

is	O
i	O
i	O
--	O
we	O
have	O
us	O
a	O
very	O
diverse	O
feel	O

We	O
have	O
a	O

of	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
from	O
different	O
country	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
--	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
are	O
pretty	O
much	O
accepting	O
and	O
I	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
bas	O
basically	O
you	O
you	O
can	O
promote	O
yourself	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
a	O
good	O
job	O
I	O
mean	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
pick	O
and	O
choose	O
you	O

Bill	O

Right	O

Alexander	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
very	O

environment	O
that	O
allows	O
you	O
to	O
grow	O
in	O

And	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
thinks	O
I	O
rightfully	O
do	O
n't	O
if	O

like	O
if	O
I	O
have	O
a	O

like	O
I	O
'll	O
freshly	O
go	O
to	O
my	O
team	O
lead	O
or	O
the	O
supervisor	O
and	O
she	O
takes	O
it	O
to	O
her	O
boss	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
boss	O
takes	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
next	O
level	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
.	O

Bill	O

Right	O
.	O

Yeah	O
but	O
that	O
--	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
very	O
important	O
.	O

Uh	O
for	O
a	O
company	O
to	O
be	O
well-run	O
it	O
has	O
to	O
have	O
uh	O
a	O
c	O
it	O
's	O
t	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
send	O
a	O
clear	O
message	O

as	O
to	O
how	O
to	O
handle	O
problems	O
and	O
who	O
who	O
is	O
the	O

that	O

uh	O
uh	O

for	O

And	O

this	O
year	O
when	O

Ron	O

Oh	O
thi	O
you	O
were	O
surprised	O
that	O
he	O
yo	O
that	O

I	O
I	O
I	O
still	O

uh	O

Ron	O

Oh	O
huh	O
how	O
interesting	O
.	O

Sherri	O

eh	O

And	O
uh	O

and	O
then	O
uh	O
with	O
Condoleezza	O
Rice	O

They	O
're	O
appointing	Start-Position
her	O
ta	O
to	O

Ron	O

Yeah	O
I	O
saw	O
that	O
.	O

Yeah	O
I	O
I	O
uh	O
that	O
one	O
I	O
think	O
one	O
probably	O
was	O
the	O
one	O
that	O
most	O
surprised	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
n't	O
I	O
had	O
n't	O
really	O
thought	O
about	O
it	O

I	O
--	O
Colin	O
Powell	O
did	O
n't	O
surprise	O
me	O
.	O

Ashcroft	O
surprised	O
me	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
um	O
but	O
um	O
I	O
sort	O
of	O
started	O
to	O
think	O
he	O
might	O
step	End-Position
down	End-Position
because	O
evidently	O
he	O
was	O
being	O
he	O
was	O
considered	O
somewhat	O
of	O
a	O
lightning	O
rod	O
for	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
more	O
controversial	O
stands	O
and	O
stuff	O
so	O

Sherri	O

Uh-huh	O

Ron	O

But	O
and	O
and	O
so	O
have	O
you	O
been	O
following	O
the	O
uh	O
the	O
proposed	O
nominees	O
?	O

I	O
mean	O
do	O
you	O
think	O

Sherri	O

Kellogg	O
the	O
Kellogg	O
guy	O
.	O

Ron	O

Oh	O
yeah	O
that	O
's	O
right	O

Where	O
's	O
he	O
going	Start-Position
to	O
Commerce	O
?	O

Is	O
that	O
where	O
he	O
's	O
headed	Start-Position
?	O

Sherri	O

Yeah	O
that	O
's	O
it	O
huh	O
?	O

Ron	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
anything	O
about	O
him	O

I	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O

anything	O
about	O
him	O

is	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
like	O
a	O
real	O
prestigious	O
uh	O
position	O
you	O

what	O
the	O
~	O
CEO	O
of	O
Kellogg	O
?	O

Ron	O

Yeah	O

I	O
guess	O
it	O
sort	O
of	O
concerns	O
me	O
that	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
're	O
looking	O
at	O

uh	O
another	O
corporate	O

you	O
know	O
this	O
is	O
like	O
a	O
--	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
a	O

I	O
think	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
real	O
problem	O

That	O
is	O
uh	O

you	O
know	O
almost	O
like	O
a	O
big	O

even	O
identify	O
it	O

Ron	O

Uh-huh	O

way	O
way	O
way	O
more	O
than	O
we	O
realize	O

Ron	O

Yeah	O
I	O
I	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
probably	O
right	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
it	O

maybe	O
even	O

true	O
under	O
this	O

we	O

Hillary	O

and	O
basically	O

Kelly	O

Oh	O
really	O
?	O

Hillary	O

he	O

killed	Die
his	O

the	O
the	O

just	O
I	O

the	O

why	O
uh	O

why	O
did	O

Hillary	O

well	O
you	O
know	O

Kelly	O

I	O
mean	O
I	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
how	O
they	O
decide	O
who	O
died	Execute
but	O
it	O
's	O
because	O
of	O
the	O

Hillary	O

you	O
know	O
and	O

Kelly	O

the	O
uh	O
cou	O
like	O
the	O

the	O
court	O
that	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
like	O
the	O
area	O
does	O
n't	O

Hillary	O

well	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
why	O
they	O
decided	O
on	O
this	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
public	O
of	O
a	O
case	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

Kelly	O

Yeah	O

Hillary	O

they	O
have	O
many	O
many	O
worse	O
crimes	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
California	O
parents	O
killing	Die
their	O
children	O
and	O
everything	O
that	O
you	O
would	O
think	O
--	O
would	O
would	O
um	O
--	O
you	O
know	O
be	O

Kelly	O

Hearing	O
more	O

Hillary	O

be	O
more	O

Kelly	O

Stringent	O

Hillary	O

yeah	O
but	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
they	O
ignore	O
those	O
because	O
this	O
one	O
got	O
on	O
television	O
I	O
guess	O
.	O

Kelly	O

keep	O
like	O

uh	O
the	O

from	O

uh	O

never	O

the	O
whole	O

and	O
and	O
getting	O
into	O
the	O
whole	O

mystery	O
of	O
it	O
because	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
the	O

's	O
dead	Die
and	O
so	O
is	O
her	O

and	O
--	O
there	O
's	O

really	O
no	O
way	O
of	O
changing	O
that	O
I	O
guess	O
.	O

Kelly	O

Yeah	O
uh	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
strange	O
how	O
it	Trial-Hearing
was	O
so	O

I	O
'm	O
just	O
seriously	O

I	O

I	O
try	O
not	O

n't	O
help	O
it	O
sometimes	O

Yeah	O
I	O
know	O

But	O
it	O
just	O
amazes	O
me	O
that	O
uh	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
ridiculous	O
how	O
publicized	O
--	O
how	O
much	O
publicity	O
it	Trial-Hearing
got	O
because	O
--	O
I	O
mean	O
there	O
's	O
like	O
human	O
rights	O
violations	O
going	O
on	O
all	O
around	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
there	O
's	O
like	O
genocide	Attack
in	O
Sudan	O
right	O
now	O
but	O
like	O
nobody	O
talks	O
about	O
that	O

That	O
's	O
like	O
-LRB-	O
-LRB-	O
-RRB-	O

Hillary	O

Oh	O
yeah	O

what	O
's	O

They	O
just	O

his	O
uh	O
comment	O
to	O

afterwards	O
was	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
he	O
just	O
did	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
honor	O
a	O

I	O

one	O

Uh	O

I	O

agreed	O
with	O
that	O
Arafat	O
thing	O
though	O

I	O
--	O
but	O
I	O
do	O

accomplished	O
something	O
in	O
that	O
the	O
Palestinian	O
people	O
do	O
have	O
a	O
legitimate	O
grievance	O

you	O

Well	O
he	O
--	O
he	O
did	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
he	O
really	O
failed	O
miserably	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
when	O
he	O
um	O
refused	O
to	O
sign	O
that	O

was	O
originally	O
set	O
up	O

it	O
was	O
a	O

option	O
and	O
it	O
really	O
could	O
've	O
re	O
done	O
some	O
wonderful	O
things	O
for	O
his	O
people	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
he	O
really	O
did	O
them	O
a	O
disservice	O
by	O
not	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
it	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
.	O

Ben	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

what	O
was	O
the	O

I	O

Sue	O

Well	O
um	O
where	O
they	O
were	O

ninety-six	O

he	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
all	O
hundred	O
percent	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
he	O
refused	O
to	O
sign	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
just	O
an	O
an	O
incredible	O
faux	O
pas	O
on	O
his	O
part	O
from	O
my	O

.	O

Ben	O

Oh	O

Yeah	O

it	O
's	O
it	O
's	O
--	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
sometimes	O

a	O

A	O

Exactly	O

Exactly	O
exactly	O
I	O
I	O

that	O
nine	O

made	O
him	O

B	O

A	O

and	O
at	O
that	O

ridiculous	O

B	O

And	O
if	O
if	O
if	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O

the	O
rest	O

the	O

knows	O
that	O
because	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
he	O

before	O

pay	O
any	O

A	O

Eh	O
--	O

you	O
're	O
right	O
you	O
're	O
quite	O
right	O

B	O

And	O
--	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
get	O
a	O
government	O
agency	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
that	O
was	O
having	O
crisis	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
times	O
I	O
mean	O
he	O
would	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
devote	O
himself	O
to	O
that	O

If	O
he	O
could	O
just	O
do	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
fine	O

A	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
point	O

B	O

But	O
if	O
he	O
gets	O
if	O
gets	O
into	O
a	O

of	O
policy	O

and	O
stuff	O
that	O
for	O
other	O
things	O
you	O

I	O
I	O
I	O
know	O
I	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

B	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O

Probably	O
would	O

a	O
good	O
attorney	O

he	O

that	O

A	O

it	O
could	O
very	O
well	O
he	O
did	O
a	O
good	O
job	O
you	O
're	O

he	O

could	O
follow	O
in	O
what	O
's	O
his	O

B	O

you	O
know	O

I	O
think	O
I	O
think	O
the	O
cases	O
that	O
he	O

chooses	O
probably	O
I	O
would	O
n't	O
necessarily	O

That	O
much	O
I	O

we	O
can	O
we	O
can	O
probably	O

that	O

uh	O
little	O

Uh	O
he	O
was	O

a	O

and	O

Derek	O

Mhm	O

Marco	O

Um	O
--	O
uh	O

seems	O

his	O
you	O

But	O
--	O
uh	O
--	O
strangely	O
I	O
felt	O
like	O
that	O
what	O
that	O
was	O
--	O
one	O
of	O
--	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
good	O
qualities	O
because	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
feel	O
Bush	O
was	O
politician	O
enough	O
.	O

That	O
um	O
--	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
--	O
issues	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
concerned	O
about	O
was	O
just	O

the	O
representation	O
of	O

on	O

and	O
I	O
just	O
--	O
uh	O
--	O
I	O
uh	O
--	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
uh	O
Bush	O
is	O

the	O
way	O
he	O
presents	O
um	O
--	O
the	O
~	O
US	O
position	O
--	O
uh	O
--	O
seemed	O
a	O
little	O

abrasive	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

Derek	O

Mhm	O

Marco	O

And	O
I	O
--	O
felt	O
like	O
hm	O
--	O
if	O
we	O
're	O
trying	O
to	O
um	O
--	O
make	O
--	O
um	O
--	O
the	O
United	O

safer	O
and	O
more	O
stable	O
--	O
conflict	Attack
in	O
the	O
world	O
more	O
stable	O
then	O
we	O
probably	O
need	O
somebody	O
--	O
who	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
--	O
of	O
a	O
politician	O
in	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
--	O
the	O
they	O
care	O
about	O
diplomacy	O
and	O
--	O
uh	O
even	O
though	O
we	O
may	O
not	O

give	O
in	O
to	O
--	O
the	O
will	O
of	O
the	O
other	O

it	O
in	O
a	O
nicer	O

Derek	O

Mhm	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
it	O
seems	O
-LRB-	O
-LRB-	O
I	O
make	O
-RRB-	O
-RRB-	O
kind	O
of	O
simplistic	O
but	O
--	O
that	O
was	O
--	O
an	O
important	O
thing	O
for	O
me	O
.	O

Uh	O

Derek	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Derek	O

Um	O
--	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
different	O
.	O

I	O
I	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
everything	O
you	O
said	O
.	O

I	O
just	O
um	O
--	O
I	O
come	O
from	O
a	O
little	O
different	O
background	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
being	O
--	O
I	O
was	O
never	O
into	O
politics	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
I	O
actually	O
have	O
gotten	O
into	O
God	O
much	O
more	O
and	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
searching	O
spirituality	O
out	O
.	O

Marco	O

Uh	O
huh	O
.	O

Derek	O

Generally	O
people	O
like	O
that	O
are	O
conservative	O
you	O
know	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Derek	O

uh	O
with	O
their	O
views	O
because	O
of	O
different	O
things	O
like	O
abortion	O
and	O
and	O
uh	O
pro-life	O
and	O
--	O
all	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
so	O
I	O
came	O
form	O
that	O
background	O

Marco	O

Uh	O
huh	O
.	O

Derek	O

eh	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
just	O
an	O
added	O
bonus	O
for	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
--	O
I	O
too	O
was	O
obviously	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
in	O
time	O
concerned	O
about	O
the	O
welfare	O
of	O
our	O
security	O
--	O
and	O
I	O
felt	O
personally	O
that	O
if	O
--	O
Kerry	O
was	O
in	O
office	O
we	O
'd	O
kind	O
of	O
be	O
uh	O
--	O
up	O
a	O
creek	O
without	O
a	O
paddle	O
because	O
I	O
think	O
--	O
he	O
is	O
so	O
laid	O
back	O
--	O
um	O
and	O
not	O
as	O
aggressive	O
as	O
Bush	O
that	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
in	O
the	O
game	O
where	O
we	O
're	O
at	O
--	O
we	O
're	O
in	O
this	O
thing	O
full	O
full	O
--	O
steam	O
ahead	O

Marco	O

Uh	O
huh	O
.	O

Derek	O

and	O
for	O
a	O
transition	O
to	O
occur	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
--	O
to	O
someone	O
who	O
is	O
laid	O
back	O
--	O
and	O
not	O
as	O
aggressive	O
as	O
him	O
I	O
think	O
would	O
actually	O
endanger	O
the	O
~	O
US	O
even	O
more	O
.	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Derek	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
international	O
uh	O
uh	O
leaders	O
would	O
look	O
at	O
Kerry	O
and	O
know	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
smart	O
I	O
mean	O
they	O
're	O
--	O
they	O
're	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
these	O
things	O
they	O
know	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
would	O
it	O
just	O
would	O
have	O
opened	O
a	O
gateway	O
.	O

Marco	O

Uh	O
huh	O
.	O

Derek	O

I	O
feel	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Derek	O

that	O
uh	O
it	O
may	O
have	O
actually	O
put	O
us	O
in	O
more	O
danger	O
.	O

At	O
least	O
Bush	O
has	O
--	O
pulled	O
out	O
the	O
gun	O
you	O
know	O
stick	O
to	O
them	O
and	O
um	O
--	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
coming	O
from	O
on	O
that	O
.	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Derek	O

And	O
then	O
when	O
I	O

Marco	O

-LRB-	O
-LRB-	O
Do	O
you	O
think	O
-RRB-	O
-RRB-	O

Derek	O

I	O
listen	O
to	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
talk	O
radio	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
heard	O
the	O
stuff	O
about	O
Kerry	O
back	O
in	O
the	O
--	O
the	O
the	O
apparently	O
the	O
scandals	O
he	O
's	O
pulled	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
uh	O
medals	O
when	O
he	O
served	O
time	O
.	O

Marco	O

Uh	O
huh	O
.	O

Derek	O

You	O
know	O
uh	O
--	O
I	O
listen	O
to	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
talk	O
radio	O
and	O
spoke	O
with	O
you	O
know	O
heard	O
from	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
uh	O
--	O
veterans	O
--	O
and	O
they	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
physically	O
uh	O
impossible	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
achieve	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
did	O
.	O

Marco	O

Uh	O
huh	O
.	O

Uh	O
huh	O
.	O

Derek	O

And	O
all	O
the	O
meetings	Meet
he	O
's	O
missing	O
and	O
just	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
status	O
quo	O
for	O
him	O
.	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Derek	O

I	O
think	O
he	O
's	O
more	O
he	O
got	O
so	O
much	O
money	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
he	O
was	O
just	O
concerned	O
with	O
attaining	O
this	O
position	O
and	O
a	O
title	O
.	O

Marco	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Derek	O

you	O
know	O
-LRB-	O
-LRB-	O
flag	O
-RRB-	O
-RRB-	O
for	O
him	O
so	O

Marco	O

Do	O
you	O
think	O
um	O
--	O
the	O
--	O
when	O
the	O
Republicans	O
are	O
campaigning	O
--	O
they	O
were	O
saying	O
that	O
well	O
another	O
attack	Attack
on	O
the	O
U.S.	O
is	O
--	O
imminent	O
that	O
it	O
probably	O
--	O
probably	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O
--	O
and	O
--	O
um	O
--	O
and	O
--	O
they	O
even	O
went	O
so	O
far	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
if	O
--	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
difficult	O
to	O
prevent	O
something	O
like	O
this	O
and	O
of	O
course	O
they	O
're	O
doing	O
the	O
best	O
they	O
can	O
and	O
--	O
I	O
think	O
Kerry	O
would	O
do	O
the	O
best	O
he	O
could	O
.	O

But	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
um	O
--	O
that	O
--	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
n't	O
quite	O
a	O
political	O
issue	O
but	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
that	O

there	O
's	O
going	O

be	O
another	O

that	O
his	O

well	O

I	O
got	O
to	O
the	O

to	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
power	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
in	O

back	O
in	O

and	O
once	O
he	O
um	O
you	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
actually	O
for	O
peace	O

was	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
-LRB-	O
-LRB-	O
send	Transport

the	O
Israelis	O
out	O
of	O
Jerusalem	O
in	O
the	O
areas	O
that	O
they	O
wanted	O
.	O

I	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
--	O
they	O
wanted	O
to	O
coexist	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
um	O
he	O
wanted	O
--	O
you	O
know	O
all	O
his	O
people	O
--	O
all	O
his	O
people	O
wanted	O
to	O

with	O
the	O
--	O
Israelis	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
um	O
his	O
death	Die
--	O
marks	O
a	O
beginning	O
of	O
trying	O
to	O
find	O
somebody	O
that	O
--	O
really	O
wants	O
peace	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
in	O
that	O
area	O
of	O
the	O
um	O
world	O
that	O
you	O
could	O
actually	O
have	O
peace	O

If	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
Bible	O
well	O
you	O
would	O
know	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
always	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
conflict	Attack
there	O
.	O

Um	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
the	O
United	O
States	O
should	O
open	O
up	O
--	O
their	O
--	O
doors	O
to	O
--	O
not	O
help	O
but	O
support	O
any	O
um	O
process	O
for	O
peace	O
in	O
the	O
area	O
though	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
get	O
involved	O
to	O
a	O
level	O
a	O
point	O
where	O
we	O
're	O
sending	Transport
people	O
over	O
there	O
and	O
um	O
trying	O
to	O
--	O
help	O
keep	O
the	O
peace	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O
um	O
.	O

There	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
stuff	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
done	O
--	O
by	O
just	O
verbal	O
suppo	O
--	O
you	O
know	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
now	O
he	O
's	O
gone	Die
his	O
family	O
is	O
still	O
around	O
and	O

Barb	O

Yeah	O

Roger	O

uh	O
millions	O
and	O
millions	O
of	O
dollars	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
is	O
still	O
around	O
but	O
they	O
--	O
if	O
they	O
bring	O
people	O
in	O
that	O
was	O
n't	O
involved	O
with	O
his	O
cabinet	O
n	O
um	O
have	O
different	O
views	O
than	O
him	O
somebody	O
that	O
gener	O
genuinely	O
can	O
accept	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
Israel	O
--	O
Is	O
Israelis	O
are	O
there	O
and	O
they	O
're	O
there	O
to	O
stay	O

and	O
um	O
we	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
coexist	O
.	O

If	O
they	O
can	O
find	O
somebody	O
like	O
that	O
then	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
f	O
support	O
him	O
and	O
um	O
and	O
back	O
him	O
up	O
--	O
in	O
trying	O
to	O
help	O
define	O

peace	O
in	O
the	O

where	O

is	O
impossible	O

What	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
about	O
it	O
?	O

Barb	O

I	O
agree	O
with	O
you	O

I	O
did	O

eh	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
listen	O
to	O
everything	O
he	O
says	O

And	O
I	O
think	O
it	O

--	O
I	O
mean	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
nice	O
to	O
have	O
peace	O
over	O
there	O
but	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
you	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
ever	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O

I	O
mean	O
not	O
the	O
way	O

not	O
the	O

they	O
'll	O
--	O
--	O
not	O
like	O
it	O
is	O
here	O

And	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
n't	O
send	Transport

We	O
've	O
got	O
