Well , I would , too .
On the other hand , the Russian legal system is a bit less , well , legalistic -- they seem much more concerned about the chance that someone will harm the state than about actual matters of right and wrong .
So it 's pretty significant that Mikhail Khodorkovsky is taking the risk of maintaining his innocence .
At this point , he has essentially no chance of recovering anything , unless Russia sees a change in political control and the US applies some pressure .
