Northshore Management Update
Byrne
2005-02-16T21 :20:00
Northshore Management , the hedge fund firm accused of stealing millions of dollars in client funds , is now facing actual SEC action .
The amount in question : $ 37 million .
While it 's not a major sum compared to the amounts consider before -LRB- as high as $ 90 million -RRB- , it 's good to see that the issue 's getting resolved .
Though , of course , there 's always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shortsighted , not actually criminal ; apparently , the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled -- so they 're guilty of front-running , at the least .
But they might have been using Northshore as an alternative source of capital : Having invested all they could risk , it would only make sense to turn to other sources .
What we 'll need to look for in the coming weeks are 1 -RRB- What happened to the money once it was invested in these companies -LRB- were they real companies , or just avenues for stolen funds ?
-RRB- and 2 -RRB- How much of this was disclosed beforehand .
