There 's Always Plan B

The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to make morning-after birth control available without a prescription .
The FDA may decide as soon as this week whether drug stores can sell the emergency contraception known as Plan B without a prescription to women age 16 and older .
Here is where I break with my conservative base and support the availability of Plan B which can prevent pregnancy for up to 72 hours after sex .
With an 89 % success rate , we can be optimistic that we are on the right path to ending unwanted pregnancy that does n't involve a scalpel or suction tube .
Conservatives say people will be less reluctant to have risky and unprotected sex if they 've got a box of B under the nightstand where condoms traditionally collect .
But I would rather Plan B be used to prevent pregnancy than the liberals ' preferred method ; a fork in the head and a knife to the spinal cord .
