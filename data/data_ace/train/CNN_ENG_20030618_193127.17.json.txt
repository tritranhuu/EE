a net worth of $ 300 million .
anyone who knows me knows my obsession with tween stars .
they 're kids eight to 14 , and for millions , their heroes are barely occupy puberty .
the reason for my obsession is simple , deep seething jealousy .
it is n't enough for these tween stars to be on the tv or movie .
they want to own every form of media and want to own it now .
unlike the corey feldman of the '80s , today 's tweens are n't content with succeeding in just one of medium .
mary indicate and ashley olsen started it all .
now they have a billion dollar empire built on videos , clothing perfume and more .
and then there 's the tween hilary duff , fans know her as lizzie mag wire .
movies , books , albums .
three corporate giants head the way .
typical , nickelodeon or disney starts them off .
then when they 're ready to breed they go to the wb .
why such a focus on these tween stars ?
it has little to do with their artistic vision .
one star told vanity fair their favorite author is whoever wrote the bible .
these kids are at that magical age when new multibillion declare spending power is put in service of intense peer pressure leading to brand loyalties that can last a lifetime .
the flip side between stars , though , is once the fans grow up their star power may dim .
do n't believe in just ask one of the coreys .
these tweens are everywhere .
they 're right on the cover of vanity fair .
tweens are all over it .
that 's the issue right there .
so we have with us vanity fair fashion director elizabeth olsen .
i was shocked when i saw them covers the tweens .
why are they so important ?
they 're important because we report on what 's happening .
we report on the culture of what 's now , what maze money , what the buzz is , what 's next .
and they 're making a lot of money .
a much more than a lot of money .
unlike stars of the past , they really are not content to be singers or dancers , they are like omnimedia , mini martha stewart .
they 're more than that , actually , because they have a television show to back themselves up , then the movie , then the clothing line .
they have much more and reach a much broader audience as well .
i saw one interviewed , and they said , yeah , when i left the cosby show at age four , i cut an album at age five .
what happened happened to being kids ?
that was the great thing about the photo shoot .
thee still young , ambitious , excited , they play dressup and have pillow fights .
who 's the ultimate tween ?
i would have i to say you have to talk about hilary duff , and you have to talk about the olsen twins .
because the olsen twins started it all .
they created it , maybe .
they more than started it .
and they started prenatal .
but they turned it into an empire , what shirley temple could have done .
had she only known .
i think their company is called dual star , like a gross of a billion dollars last year .
they work hard .
they 're not just sitting there hiring people to do their business .
they do their own business , and they 're well-rounded and polite people .
are they nice ?
they 're so nice and cool .
how about that ?
they 're actually very , very cool .
i 'm not sure of that .
and hilary duff is a star , and i guarantee you , they will grace their own cover .
do they all have staying power ?
one ca n't predict that all have it , but some have it .
it depends on who 's managing it , what career choices they make , what their parents help them to do .
it would be interesting to see the audience that sort of adores them now , whether
