Czech nuclear plant gets permission to produce at full capacity
PRAGUE , Czech Republic -LRB- AP -RRB-
The troubled nuclear power plant in Temelin received permission from state authorities Monday to start power production at full capacity .
Pavel Pitterman , the spokesman for the State Office for Nuclear Safety , said his office gave the plant permission to run its second , newer 1,000-megawatt unit at full capacity .
The plant 's first 1,000-megawatt unit has already operated at full capacity during past tests .
The spokesman for the Temelin plant , Milan Nebesar , said that an 18-month trial production at full capacity at the second unit , needed to declare the unit ready for commercial production , would start Friday .
The plant , based on Russian design and upgraded with U.S. technology , has been plagued by frequent , non-nuclear malfunctions since testing began in November 2000 .
Located just 60 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- north of the Austrian border , it has been a source of friction between the two countries .
Critics in non-nuclear Austria argue the plant is unsafe and demand that it be shut down , but Czech authorities insist the plant is safe .
The plant 's first unit , currently shut down for planned maintenance scheduled to take two months , has already entered the last stage of tests and should be ready for commercial use at the end of 2003 .
