New Explosions in Mosul , Baghdad
WOODRUFF
It was in northern Iraq today that an eight artillery round hit the site occupied by Kurdish fighters near Chamchamal .
It happened near an area abandoned earlier by Iraqi forces .
CNN 's Kevin Sites is in northern Iraq .

KEVIN SITES , CNN CORRESPONDENT
This is the road to Kirkuk .
A day ago it was controlled by Iraqi troops and packed with these land mines but now we can drive far enough to see the outskirts of Kirkuk .
That 's because coalition fighter jets pummeled this Iraqi position on the hills above Chamchamal and Iraqi troops made a hasty retreat .
This is what the hilltop looks like now , craters 15 feet deep , busted bunkers and twisted metal , scattered ammunitions and tattered clothing , a helmet , a tube of toothpaste .
Kurdish Peshmerga fighters took their place .
I 'm glad to see them go this one says .
They killed a lot of our people in Chamchamal but I feel bad for them too .
Some of them were only conscripts .
Some Kurds took advantage of the Iraqi retreat right away .
This one took a bulldozer to a concrete portrait of Saddam Hussein .
It took about 20 minutes but finally it came toppling down .
He says after finishing the job he hopes Saddam Hussein himself will fall too but despite the exuberance of Kurds in the area , it 's clear it 's much too early to celebrate .
Although the Iraqis retreated from this area , at dusk they fired what observers say were seven artillery rounds back at their former stronghold creating new fear and potentially new casualties .

WOODRUFF
All right and when we return , waiting here on the home front , a very special reunion between a Marine and his wife .
There is no greater gap probably than that between the troops overseas and their loved ones here at home .
CNN helped bridge that cassum -LRB- ph -RRB- at least temporarily between Sergeant Craig Martin of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit and his wife Kaycee Martin in California .
They talked by videophone this morning .

ANDERSON COOPER , CNN ANCHOR
You 're eight months pregnant I believe .
How has this been for you ?
KAYCEE MARTIN , WIFE OF SOLDIER
It 's been difficult .
It 's hard without him .
I 'm doing OK but it would be much better if he was home with me .
COOPER
If I could just ask , I mean and you know I do n't want to pry so anytime I ask something you do n't want to say just tell me to shut up but what is it like for you watching all this coverage ?
I mean watching , you know , the access .
The pictures were seeing are really historic in what we are able to see .
Is it more - does it make it more difficult ?
Does it make it easier ?
K. MARTIN
It 's very difficult .
It 's hard .
The whole time though you 're just sitting there trying to catch a glimpse just to see if maybe one of the people on TV is him but you know he tells me do n't watch , do n't watch .
You know , it 's going to be difficult but like I said , it 's just too hard .
I want to be able to see just to make sure that he 's OK , just catch a glimpse of him .
COOPER
How does he look to you right now ?
K. MARTIN
He looks all right , but dirty .
SGT. CRAIG MARTIN , 15TH MARINE EXPEDITIONARY UNIT
I lost my tooth .
K. MARTIN
Beautiful .
Thanks .
Thanks for showing me .
COOPER
How 'd you - how 'd you lose your tooth ?
C. MARTIN
Sorry .
COOPER
Can I ask ?
How did you lose your tooth ?
C. MARTIN
When we came across the bridge , the enemy launched some 155 artillery rounds at us .
It came pretty close and the concussion knocked my tooth out .
K. MARTIN
Great .
C. MARTIN
Yes .
K. MARTIN
It does n't sound like you 're being too careful .
C. MARTIN
It was fun though .
We 're all right .
COOPER
Sergeant Martin I do n't know if you see , your wife 's sort of shaking her head .
C. MARTIN
Careful as I can be .
It 's all good .
COOPER
Sergeant Martin , is there anything else ...
C. MARTIN
I love you .
COOPER
Is there anything else you would like to say either to your wife or to all the people who are watching this ?
I know this awkward , you know , doing this on TV and I hate to put you in this position but feel free .
C. MARTIN
Yeah .
I 've got a couple of things real quick .
To my old man , this is not a distraction .
To my wife , we 'll be home soon and I love you .
That 's all I 've got to say .
COOPER
Well that says a lot .
Kaycee , anything else you want to say ?
K. MARTIN
I love you very much .
I miss you very much .
Everyone is praying for you and I just want you to come home safe and soon so you could see our new baby .
C. MARTIN
One more thing , you look really beautiful right now .
K. MARTIN
Thanks .
I 'd like to say the same to you .
C. MARTIN
That 's stylish .
Do n't worry .
We 'll take it home .
K. MARTIN
Well , just come home soon .
C. MARTIN
Without a doubt .
K. MARTIN
-- Well , just come home soon .
C. MARTIN
I 'll try baby .

WOODRUFF
A little embarrassing for us to watch .
It 's got to be difficult talking to your loved one in front of thousands and thousands of people on television , millions .
Well , in addition to the baby on the way , the Martins also have a three-year-old daughter .
And that is it for this hour .
I 'm Judy Woodruff in Washington .
Wolf Blitzer 's report starts right now .
