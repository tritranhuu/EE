Russia 's Situation Worsens

Gazprom , the main Russian gas company , has been denied a $ 10 billion credit line due to the political situation in Russia .
The company intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos assets -LRB- hence that firm 's bankruptcy filing a few days ago -- you know it 's bad when you have to use US courts to protect your own assets from appropriation by your home country -RRB- .
It 's starting to look like Putin 's goal is a sort of judicial nationalization -- taking control of key assets through court , rather than executive , fiat .
But the markets have caught on , and Russia may be deprived of the capital it needs to grow .
Do n't expect any of the Russian leadership to reverse course ; given the current trends there , they 'll just Blame the West when their screwy plan screws them over .
