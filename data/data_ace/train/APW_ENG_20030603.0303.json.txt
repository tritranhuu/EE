State refused bid to prosecute acquitted apartheid germ warfare head
BLOEMFONTEIN , South Africa -LRB- AP -RRB-
South Africa 's Supreme Court of Appeal ruled Tuesday against a state request to retry the head of apartheid 's germ warfare program , once accused of plotting to poison Nelson Mandela .
Wouter Basson was acquitted in April 2002 on 46 charges , ranging from murder and drug trafficking to fraud and theft .
Basson was accused of directing South Africa 's former apartheid regime 's biochemical efforts aimed at destroying its opponents .
The ruling by judges Piet Streicher and Mohamed Navsa of the Supreme Court of Appeal , the highest appeals court in the country , means that Basson can not be tried again and his acquittal stands , the South African Press Association reported .
The state 's appeal was based on the judge refusing to recuse himself during Basson 's 2Â 1/2 - year trial .
The prosecution alleged presiding Judge Willie Hartzenberg favored Basson .
The appeal judges found Hartzenberg 's refusal did not relate to an error of law on his part .
Basson headed a program named Project Coast in the 1980 's .
During the trial witnesses testified that the project involved trying to create deadly bacteria and anti-fertility drugs that would only affect blacks .
They poisoned opponents ' clothing and stockpiled cholera , HIV and anthrax .
The alleged intended victims included former President Nelson Mandela and several African National Congress leaders who are now high-ranking government officials .
He had also been accused of siphoning millions of dollars from Project Coast to finance a lavish , globe-trotting lifestyle and of selling drugs .
