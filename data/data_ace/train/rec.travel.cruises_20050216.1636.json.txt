Renewal of marriage vows on carnival cruise
Has anybody out there seen this done ?
I saw somewhere on their site there is a lot of prep time needed to get married onboard .
I wonder if its easier just renewing your vows as my wife has been looking for this for a while .
going out on the Sensation in March for our 18th anniverary .

Re : Renewal of marriage vows on carnival cruise
My wife and I were guests at a wedding on the Carnival Legend on New Years Eve 2003 .
All the guests were folks who had met the bride and groom -LRB- an attractive young couple who were sailing alone -RRB- virtually on cruisecritic .
The wedding took place in the afternoon , before the ship set sail .
Thus , the couple was actual married by a justice of the peace in the state of Florida .
It was a great way to begin a cruise .
Although I am not certain of this , I assume that renewing your vows could actually be done while the ship was at sea , because it would not involve any legal issues .

I do n't know the details , but on my last cruise there was a LARGE wedding going on .
The bride was all decked out in her long gown and veil , groom in tux and the other wedding party all dressed to the nines !
They had one of the larger lounges closed off for a private reception .
I did n't think it was allowed any more , but 30 minutes until sailing an announcement was made that all NON CRUISE guests must make their way to disembark the ship prior to sailing .
I had never heard that announcement before so I assumed that it was for the people attending the wedding on board ?
This was the largest wedding gathering I have ever seen on board ... maybe someone had connections ??? The bride was still visible later into the evening still wearing her wedding gown on the Lido Deck !

On 16 Feb 2005 13:36:29 -0800 ,
We renewed our vows on Carnival Conquest on 10/31/2004 - you need to contact Carnival wedding department and ask if they have any wedding/renewal packages available .
These usally take a little time to set up - if you are going in March I am not sure if/what would be available to you .
They were just starting a new Renewal of Vows program , which included all we rec 'd , but was cheaper .
Since we had already paid for our package we kept it .
Had a very nice ceremony with a justice of the peace and a small reception for the family members traveling with us .
Call Carnival Wedding Dept. at 1 -LRB-800-RRB-Â 933-4968 or send an email to :

Happy anniversary and enjoy your cruise !
