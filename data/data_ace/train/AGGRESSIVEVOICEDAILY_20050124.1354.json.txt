This past weekend marked the 32-year anniversary of Roe v. Wade , the landmark Supreme Court decision that gave way for the imminent slaughter of 43 million unborn children across the country in the name of `` women 's rights .
''
Today , thousands of pro-life crusaders will participate in the March for Life in Washington D.C. , to honor the defenseless children and hope for an eventual Supreme Court reversal .
A reversal would not only be a victory for those who value life , but also for the woman once known as Jane Roe -- now a passionate pro-life advocate trying to get the Supreme Court to overturn the case she once represented .
Michelle Malkin has the goods on the March as well as links to other resources .
