Former Senator Chuck Robb has n't been heard from lately .
Parade magazine reminds us today that he 's a co-chair of the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction .
They will report on March 31 .
I suspect Rob will speak out after that date , although much of the Committee 's report will be classified .
Virginia is blessed to have so many respected foreign policy and security policy public servants , past and present .

Good old Chuck Robb ... I assume everyone on here has seen `` The Perfect Candidate '' ?
Quite a treat .
