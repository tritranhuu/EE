I really miss the days when a major international oil company could basically buy some tiny , ill-established foreign government to get at its natural resources .
We 've progressed a bit since then : Now , the third world countries all have their own state oil companies , who are picking apart the carcasses of once-private concerns .
The Capital Spectator reports on the latest : Not only China , but India 's state oil company has decided to get into the Yukos-dismemberment trade .
