Back in 1996 , budget cuts eliminated the job of State Archaeologist .
Now , according to the Virginian-Pilot , the job is about to come back via HB 2078 .
With all this surplus floating around and the Jamestown 2007 celebration coming up , who wants the state to be shorthanded in archaeology ?
The last State Archaeologist , Catherine Slusser , is still around , according to the article , serving the Department of Historical Resources .
She describes the untenable ongoing situation with archaeology budget cuts : `` Few Virginia employees have attended national conferences .

Though taxpayers are malcontent ,
The Assembly wo n't refund a cent .
With so much to spend ,
They followed the trend
And gave us a certified rodent .

Governor Mark , pudding and pie
Tax those citizens and make them cry
When the anti-taxers came out to play
Governor Mark ran away .
