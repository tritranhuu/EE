Death of Arafat -LRB- 2 -RRB- PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week , after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death .
What do you think caused his illness , and could it have been something malicious -LRB- like poisoning -RRB- ?
What do you think of Israel 's policies surrounding Arafat 's illness and death ?
Should President Bush or a senior US official have attended Arafat 's funeral ?
Should Israel have let Arafat be buried in Jerusalem ?
James
Hello ?
Joe
Hello , my name is Joe .
James
I 'm James from Detroit .
Joe
Uh , from , uh , New Jersey , but I 'm living in Atlanta now , going to college .
James
Oh , okay .
Joe
All right .
James
-LRB- -LRB- I 'm sorry .
-RRB- -RRB-
Joe
So , uh , what do you think about Arafat ?
James
Well -- I , uh , I do n't think there was anything malicious , uh , in terms of his death -- uh , just looking at him these last , uh , couple of years uh , it seems like he had Alzheimer 's or something .
Joe
Yeah , he has been getting older .
James
Yeah , because he was quivering at the mouth and and hands were shaking .
And -- I would imagine that living in that compound could n't have been that conducive to his health .
Joe
Yeah , he probably should have been in a hospital or a hospice or
James
Right .
Joe
you know , if it was that bad .
James
Right .
Right , I 'm sure that they , I do n't know about , bout -- the uh sanitary conditions there , but -- I I just do n't think it could have been , uh , conducive to his health .
And as far as , uh , Israel , uh , allowing -- him to be buried -- uh , in Jerusalem
Joe
That 's accept
James
huh ?
Joe
That 's acceptable to me .
I mean
James
Well , it , it 's acceptable to me , but I do n't think it was feasible .
Joe
feasible
James
Yeah , given the circumstance in that area right now .
I do n't even know if they would have been able to pull it off , you know ?
Joe
Well , uh , so he , in fact he was n't
James
Pardon me ?
Joe
so , um -- no , so he was n't buried in Jerusalem .
James
No .
No , they buried him -- uh , inside that compound .
Joe
Oh , I see .
James
Yeah , they buried him inside that compound .
But like you say , I do n't , I do n't -- I personally -- uh -- would n't have seen a problem with it , but -- I just do n't think it was feasible .
I do n't , I do n't think that they would have been -- uh , secure enough to really do it .
I do n't think either side would have really -- let it happen -- and -- and as far as a senior U.S. official going , I do n't think that would have been necessary either .
Um , I know President Bush should n't have went -- and he was n't going .
Joe
Well , I kind of feel , I kind of feel another way .
I think a senior U.S. service in there , should have been there , because I mean -- he , Arafat 's been -- been the one coming to all these peace talks , you know , with President Clinton and , you know , other
James
Mhm .
Joe
other um -- litigations towards that .
James
Mhm .
Joe
You know , I think , I think we could have just showed our face and said you know , yeah , we do recognize this man .
James
Mhm .
Well it , they sent someone .
I do n't know who it was -- -LRB- -LRB- It was n't -RRB- -RRB-
Joe
It probably , it was n't anybody important .
It was just like a
James
Yeah it was an under secretary , there 's no doubt about it .
There was no senior
Joe
James
there was no senior U.S. official there .
There 's there 's no question about that .
Joe
Yeah .
James
But , uh -- you know , uh , Bush 's policy -- towards , uh , Yasser Arafat has been hands off
Joe
Yeah .
James
from from the beginning cause I do n't , I do n't think he ever even met with him .
Did he ?
Joe
I do n't think so .
I do n't think so .
James
Yeah , I I
Joe
Bush is kind of like , staying away from the whole Israel -- Palestinian
James
Mhm .
Now on his part I think that was a mistake .
Joe
Yeah .
James
Yeah , you know you got to engage people in some type of dialogue
Joe
And
James
if you
Joe
to me , the talk , the peace talks should have continued -- after Clinton 's administration left .
James
True .
Joe
Cause at the cause at the end Clinton was doing all this peace talk with Arafat and , um
James
True .
Mhm .
Joe
-LRB- -LRB- forget -RRB- -RRB- the um , prime minister in Israel , but he was talking to him .
James
Uh , Sharon .
Joe
Sharon , yeah .
James
Yeah .
Mhm .
Joe
They were doing all these talks in Camp David and and it should have just continued when Br - Bush came into office .
James
You 're absolutely right .
I agree .
Like I said , I think that was one of Bush 's biggest mistakes ,
Joe
Mhm .
James
not continuing -- the talks .
Because Clinton had came so very close
Joe
Yes .
James
to to maybe getting some type of agreement
Joe
No .
James
but , uh , Bush just took a hands off approach .
He just -- kind of took a hands off approach .
Joe
And now the situation in , you know , Jerusalem and the West Bank is just -- escalated .
James
Absolutely .
And I think too -- Israel 's -- position toward Arafat -- in terms of keeping him sort of like -- uh -- surrounded in that compound -- I do n't think that was a good idea .
Joe
No .
James
You know , because that , you ca n't pick a leader for a people .
Whether you like them or not -- people get to choose who they want to follow ,
Joe
Exactly .
James
and the Palestinians had made it clear -- that Arafat was their leader .
Joe
Exactly .
James
So , I think that they , we should have found a way -- Israel should have found a way -- to -- keep some type of dialogue -- going along .
Cause uh , I mean , you look at what 's going on now .
Joe
Mhm .
James
I mean , their policy toward him did n't get them anything .
And then you got suicide bombing on the one side , and then you got Israel -- you know , it 's like one day , you 'll he - a bomb will go off , the next day Israel will do and air strike and -- you know , it 's like going around in a circle .
Joe
Yeah .
James
It 's like going around in a circle .
Joe
It 's really a bad situation .
James
It is .
It is , and it 's , it 's been so long -- going on , I mean , you 're talking about something that 's been going on historically for hundreds of years .
Joe
Hundreds of years and then , it just recently really come into spectrum ,
James
Mhm .
Joe
what , nineteen forty nine ?
James
Mhm .
Mhm .
Joe
When um -- the Israel state -- came into being , or whatever .
James
Right .
Right .
