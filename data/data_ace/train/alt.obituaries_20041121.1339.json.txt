Re : Yasser Arafat Murdered ?
There has always been that urban legend that the Israeli secret police murdered the Shah of Iran by infecting him with plutonium , which manifested itself into terminal lung cancer .

Re : Yasser Arafat Murdered ?
I do n't mean to suggest that I agree with anything David Frum says , but these Arafat-had-AIDS allegations remind me of what happened with the late Israeli singer Ofra Haza , where there was a lot of speculation , a mysterious death from a `` blood disease , '' and then it came out eventually that she 'd died of AIDS .
-LRB- Although I would think the Israeli media , who were blamed for hushing up Haza 's cause of death , would take a unique pleasure in making the most of Arafat 's , if all this was true .

Re : Yasser Arafat Murdered ?
No , they do n't .
The `` suspicious evidence '' is simply that Arafat did not look particularly near death when he was removed from his HQ .
He appeared alert and functioning , certainly not a week away from death from wasting .
Who really benefits from his death ?
Surely not the Israelis , who had him trapped and functioning as a convenient target for blame .
Are Kissinger Associates trying to start a `` Palestinian Civil War '' like their Lebanese one a generation ago ?
It 's hardly a similar situation .
