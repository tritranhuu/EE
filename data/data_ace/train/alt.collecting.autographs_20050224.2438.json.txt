member of the uacc
there is a lady by the name of Irene Sokolas that is selling on Ebay under VARIOUS names .
She is saying she 's a member of the UACC .
She is selling FORGERIES .
I have contacted the UACC and told them about it so they can check the auctions -LRB- she 's been doing this a long time -RRB- and to tell me if she 's actually a registered member .
I would suggest everyone read the body of the entire item they 're bidding on .
EVERYTHING .
If you see her name , stay clear .
No matter WHICH ID she 's using .
Also , I have seen in the past , others reselling items usuing her COA 's .
Be careful .
I am miffed the UACC would not check into people before allowing them to be members if in fact she is a member .
But I will reserve judgement till they respond .
This makes one really skeptical .
But if you see a UACC member on Ebay , do n't automatically assume they are legit .
Contact the UACC before buying and ask if they are a member .
If you suspect something is fake , do not take it for granted it 's legit because a UACC number is attached to it .
In cases where the member claims and IS a UACC member , still question and then if you suspect there are a number of fakes by that person , do NOT hesitate to let the UACC and Ebay know .
Hope I spared someone here of potential grief and saved someone some money !

Re : member of the uacc
The only thing that being a UACC member means is that they paid membership dues .
It does n't make them honest sellers .
UACC registered dealers are more carefully checked out and should be considered to be honest .
Of course , there are exceptions to everything .
Here is a link to the list of UACC registered dealers :
