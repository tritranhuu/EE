Here 's my second morning NPR post in a row ... Mickey Kaus in Slate was listening : Here 's how NPR 's All Things Considered covered President Bush 's proposed cuts in Community Development Block Grants -- by lobbing softballs to a CDBG supporter !
No opposing view .
... This is not just liberal , but dumb liberal -- NPR could easily have found a Democrat , maybe even an old Democrat , who believed CDBGs are an ineffective antipoverty program .
-LRB- Basically they are slush funds for local politicians , who too often sluice the federal money to their developer friends to build ugly downtown hotels .
-RRB- It 's my sense that in Virginia , the CDBG program is used extensively in rural areas and , on the whole , has done some good .
Maybe someone knows of CDBG funds used in Virginia as Mickey describes .
I hope not , but , if so , it looks like there wo n't be as much of that in the future .
