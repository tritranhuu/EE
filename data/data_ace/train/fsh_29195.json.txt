Bush Cabinet President Bush has just been elected to another term in office , and he has already started to appoint new people to his political cabinet as current members like Colin Powell and John Ashcroft resign .
Who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet next term ?
Who are they , and why do you think they should be appointed ?
If you were president , which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why ?
What new cabinet positions would you create and who would fill them ?
A
Um -- and then I I do n't -- know who would you who else would you -- well what about Ruly -- Rudolph Giuliani
B
Well .
I do n't know .
I you know what ?
I think -- I think Rudy Giuliani was a great mayor -- for nine eleven .
A
Right .
B
I do n't think he was a great mayor the whole time he was a mayor .
A
Well , I I 'm a New Yorker , and I got to tell you that I I think nine eleven I I think -- basically made him .
Other than that , I think he was a little too decisive .
B
Yeah .
A
Uh not I should n't say decisive , too divisive .
B
Yeah , I think he
A
As far as -- the race relationship in this city .
You know , it does n't take much to to please -- the other side .
And that and that 's what government is all about .
B
no , it does n't .
A
And he -- he was n't -- he was n't too much of a good uh
B
He he would 've gone out as a mediocre mayor had it not .
And I but even even saying that I ca n't begrudge him .
But he did a great job in the crisis .
Some people do better in crises .
A
Yeah .
Exactly .
Exactly , exactly , I I think that nine eleven made him and
B
Yeah .
A
and at that point in time , he wanted to stay on , which was sort of sort of ridiculous .
B
And if if if I do n't think the rest of the country knows that , because they do n't know what he did before nine eleven , because they do n't pay any attention .
A
Eh -- Exactly .
Exactly , of course , you 're right , you 're quite right .
B
And -- I think that if he did get a government agency , it would have to be one that was having crisis a lot of times I mean , he would just have to devote himself to that .
If he could just do that , it would be fine .
A
It 's a good point .
B
But if he gets if gets into a lot of policy making and stuff that for other things , you know ,
A
Yeah , yeah .
Yeah , I I I I know I one of the
B
I do n't know .
Probably would be a good attorney general , he did that
A
it could very well , he did a good job , you 're right , he probably could follow in what 's his name 's footsteps .
B
you know .
I think I think the cases that he picks and chooses probably I would n't necessarily put on top of the list , but he did seem to
A
Right .
B
prosecute everybody evenly .
A
Yeah .
That much I think we can we can probably agree with .
He will probably do that evenly .
B
Yes .
Right .
A
I you know who I thought would have made a great , uh well I I know you guys had your own political uh struggles in Jersey .
B
Right .
Yeah .
A
Um and uh
B
It 's a soap opera .
A
oh it certainly was , I I saw the footage .
I
B
Right , right , all of a sudden .
I 'll tell you this .
Within one day , everybody I met said -- oh , McGreevey , sure , I knew that .
A
Oh really ?
B
That became the national thing to say in Jersey , and in Jersey .
Like , everybody knew it , I 'd be like , you did not .
Nobody knew that .
A
In Jersey ?
Yeah I think I was -- I think I was -- I was on a cruise , and I put on the television uh when I got in at the six oh clock news , and bingo , there he is , uh resigning as Governor of uh New Jersey .
I said , you 've got to be kidding me .
B
Yeah .
A
But uh -- I thought he would have made a name for himself .
um -- I I ca n't think of anyone anyone that anyone else out there that um -- that warrants .
I mean , you know , you just
B
No .
A
pick people who I think will uh -- have the experience in government .
Well not in , not in government , but in the private sector .
Um -- who are responsible , and um -- put them in a position to lead .
B
Well , Yeah , I think uh -- apparently -- the President likes people that are the same philo - -- political philosophy as him , and I 'm not sure I mean I think he just needs some other voices in there , but
A
That 's right .
B
I do n't know if it 'll happen .
It 's
A
That 's a good point .
Well , I
B
or not .
He he needs some liberals in there and he needs some -- Ralph Nader people , and some Green Party people , and some , just some .
A
Well I I think more conservative , what do you call them ?
Conservative uh -- um -- um what do you call them ?
Uh conservative uh -- more -- oh bloody he -
B
Ideologues ?
A
I yeah well I guess you could look at it that way , yeah .
B
eh
A
Um .
Um .
I did n't particularly like the the tone about the the religious uh -- side of -- the that election .
I I thought that was a little crazy .
B
Yeah , I think pretty wack .
A
If it 's one thing we need to be careful about , it 's separating the Church from
B
Exactly , I 'm a pastor , and that bothers me .
A
and -- uh -- Yeah .
Oh I I 'm glad to hear some uh an actual pastor who says that .
I I I think that we need to make sure that that that
B
Yeah .
A
that stays the way it is .
I think it serves everyone well .
B
Well , for one thing , it it ends up as the uh -- government officials are those seeking office , and uh -- preaching and teaching to people , and that 's my job .
A
Right .
I agree .
B
That 's what I do .
You mind your stuff , I 'll tell my people what we 're doing .
