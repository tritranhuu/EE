Re : Indonesia warned about tsunamis
`` Minutes after a massive earthquake rocked the Indian Ocean on Sunday , international ocean monitors knew that a tsunami would likely follow .
But they did n't know whom to tell .
`` We put out a bulletin within 20 minutes , technically as fast as we could do it , '' says Jeff LaDouce of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
LaDouce says e-mails were dispatched to Indonesian officials , but he does n't know what happened to the information .
''
It looks more like the Indonesian officials were n't sitting at their computer or did n't have their email client set for 10 minute checks for new mail .
Email !
For Heaven 's sake , get with the real world .
It 's too bad those NOAA people had n't used the telephone .
I wonder if the -LRB- few -RRB- lives they could have saved if they 'd used a modicum of common sense will prey on their minds .

Re : Indonesia warned about tsunamis
Well , I have yet to hear that scientists from any other country even made the attempt the American scientists made .
Perhaps the Indonesian government should have taken steps to set up a hotline of sorts that could be used in case of such emergencies .
As the article notes , the American scientists did not know who to contact .
That 's hardly their problem , let alone their fault .

Re : Indonesia warned about tsunamis
And you pick up the phone in the embassy .
A voice on the other end of the line says he 's a scientist with NOAA and that a tsunami is bearing down on your coastal villages and resorts .
Thousands could die .
How would you react to such a call ?
I thought so .
All the more reason that the Indonesian government should have taken steps to set up a hotline of sorts that could be used in case of such emergencies .

The Boston Globe points out that New England has no system in place to warn residents of tidal waves , which are known to happen off New England .
Sediment slumps on the continental slope could trigger a tsunamai affecting Newfoundland to Georgia .

The entire East Coast of the U.S. does not have a tsunami warning system .

Re : Indonesia warned about tsunamis
On the other hand , if you were a scientist at NOAA and were into saving people from tsunamis , you would think you might have figured out beforehand who you might call if you did get some advanced warning of such an event .
Also , the Indonesian government probably had no idea that NOAA could give them advanced warning of tsunamis so how could they know they should set up a hotline .
So it cuts both ways , the Indonesian government should have done some prior planning , but so too should the NOAA scientists .
You can bet they are figuring out who they should have call next time .

Re : Indonesia warned about tsunamis
It 's not the responsibility of NOAA to set up hotlines to governments around the world .
The Indonesian government should have contacted the U.S. State Department and provided U.S. officials with the contact info .

Do you think they warned the USAF boys in Diego Garcia ?
It 's highest point is only 20 ' above sea level .
If the seabed slopes upward near it , one might expect nothing remains of the base and its personnel .

Re : Indonesia warned about tsunamis
FWIK the Indian ocean was not considered a tsunami prone area .
Hopefully we will learn something from this and put some reasonable warning systems in place .
We just learned that our friend 's daughter when to Thailand to visit her father after the wave hit .
There has been no contact with her since she left .
