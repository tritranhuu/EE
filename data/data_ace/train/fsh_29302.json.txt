Hillary
Hello .
Kelly
Hello ?
Hillary
Hi , my name is Hillary .
Kelly
Hey , hello .
My name 's Kelly .
Could you hold on for a second ?
Hillary
Sure .
Kelly
One , okay .
Hello ?
Hillary
Mhm .
Kelly
Hillary ?
Hillary
Yeah .
Kelly
Hey , yeah , okay .
Hillary
It 's uh
Kelly
So the
Hillary
a pretty -- depressing topic for today .
Kelly
yeah , I guess so .
The truth is I do n't really , uh , I do n't really know much about that topic .
I did n't really follow the trial very closely at all
Hillary
we do n't have , uh , cable so we purposely did n't watch the trial , but I read about it on the internet .
Kelly
so
Hillary
and basically
Kelly
Oh , really ?
Hillary
he -- killed his wife when she was -- eight months pregnant and -- and dumped her in , uh -- the ocean , basically .
Kelly
So why was it so special ?
Why did that , uh -- particular case make -- the the national news ?
Hillary
I think it 's because it was in such , it was like a , um
Kelly
Like
Hillary
it was -- in such a quiet , upscale community where it happened and -- um just I think the fact of her being eight months pregnant , um , drew a lot of attention and
Kelly
Yeah .
Hillary
of course people were worried about her for a long time and then they found her and blah blah blah .
It was -- gossip , basically .
Kelly
-LRB- -LRB- Yeah , right .
-RRB- -RRB- Oh , but the mistress had nothing to do with the murder ?
Hillary
I think -- yeah , cause he found out , they found out he had a mistress , and then it was like , oh -- Yeah .
Are -- I do n't think , I do n't think so , but who knows ?
I do n't know .
Kelly
Right .
Hillary
very sad cause she has a child herself and so she drug her son through a lot of -- uh , drama that he did n't need to be part of .
Kelly
Wait , what happened ?
Hillary
I do n't know .
She has a son too , so he he also got put -- um -- you know , in the spotlight a bit , from what I understand .
I did n't , I do n't have TV though , so I do n't really know .
Kelly
Oh , the son of the , right right .
Hillary
of -- of his girlfriend , yeah .
Kelly
Yeah .
Hillary
I do n't know .
I hear though , that he 's going to be -- the first person to be -LRB- -LRB- -RRB- -RRB- um -- uh -- killed for a crime in California in like , thirty five years or something .
Oh .
Kelly
Oh , really ?
Hillary
I do n't know if they 've , I do n't know if they 've -- um -- given him the death penalty yet .
But I think he would be the first in , in a really long time to actually -- be killed .
Kelly
Yeah , that 's amazing .
Hillary
I do n't
Kelly
Um -- why , uh , now why did they decide that this was to be this big -LRB- -LRB- -RRB- -RRB- out of this with the most heinous crime in all of California ?
Hillary
well , you know
Kelly
I mean I guess that 's not how they decide who died , but it 's because of the
Hillary
you know , and
Kelly
the , uh , cou - , like the -- the court that they went to , like the area does n't
Hillary
well , I do n't know why they decided on this , I think it was because it was so public of a case .
But they have a lot of
Kelly
Yeah .
Hillary
they have many many worse crimes going on in California , parents killing their children and everything , that you would think -- would would , um -- you know , be
Kelly
Hearing more .
Hillary
be more
Kelly
Stringent penalties ,
Hillary
yeah , but they do n't , they ignore those because this one got on television , I guess .
Kelly
keep like -- uh , the jury from watching ~ TV and the media and stuff .
But I guess now -LRB- -LRB- it 's , uh -RRB- -RRB- -- pretty much impossible -- to do .
Hillary
I i do n't know .
I never really got the whole -- watching it on ~ TV and and getting into the whole -- mystery of it because , in the end , the woman 's dead and so is her child and -- and -- there 's -- really no way of changing that I guess .
Kelly
Yeah , uh , I think it 's kind of strange how it was so publicized .
Like I 'm just , seriously , like I do n't , like I try not to watch , like -- too much , like
Hillary
You ca n't help it sometimes .
Kelly
Yeah I know .
But it just amazes me that , uh , I think it 's ridiculous how publicized -- how much publicity it got because -- I mean there 's like human rights violations going on all around the world .
I mean there 's like , genocide in Sudan right now but like , nobody talks about that .
That 's like -LRB- -LRB- -RRB- -RRB-
Hillary
Oh yeah and what 's going on in , I know and people -- flock , flock to the store to buy all their -- all their foreign made goods and it 's like what are you -- doing ?
Obviously they do n't really care about what 's going on .
They just like to hear the details .
Maybe if they could hear the details about other things they would be more involved .
I do n't know .
Kelly
Um -LRB- -LRB- -RRB- -RRB- it 's almost like , uh -- -LRB- -LRB- -RRB- -RRB- diversion but it just seems like they just make it into like , like a soap opera for people to watch , you know ?
Hillary
Well you know , some people were glued to their ~ TVs for weeks , and it 's just to disturbing that that would be their -- their main entertainment during the day .
Kelly
Oh yeah , definitely .
It 's creepy .
Hillary
Especially when there 's so many other things they could be doing .
We have three kids .
I could not sit around all day and watch a murder trial on ~ TV , especially with my kids around .
