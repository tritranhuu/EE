S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy .
My uncle declared bankruptcy in 2003 and his case closed in June 2004 .
If I give him shares in my corporation in Feb 2004 of my S Corporation making him 30 % shareholder , and I finally distributed profit this year , will the creditors attempt to that take money from him in 2005 ?

Probably not .
But if he was required to list the shares in bankruptcy filings , and did n't , the answer may be different .
I think , though , that any transaction after the bankruptcy filing date is part of his new life .

Was the trustee informed of the transfer of the shares ?
Since you gave your uncle the shares prior to his discharge , the shares should have become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debts .
If the share transfer was reported to the trustee and the trustee did nothing about them , then you may be ok ; however , if you failed to inform the trustee , then your uncle may be liable for hiding assets , which would , at the minimum , invalidate his discharge .
Even if the transfer does n't invalidate the whole discharge , the distribution might be subject to forfeiture to pay creditors ' claims if you failed to inform the trustee of the share transfer .
You need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pronto ; this is a bankruptcy matter , not a tax matter .

the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003 , but it didnt clear until early 2004 and that was when i gave him the shares .
He had no shares in 2003 .

Re : S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy .
Yes , but according to the facts you first gave , he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares .
I believe you had said that you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the discharge did n't come until June of 2004 .
That means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy , which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors .
A bankruptcy case does n't close until you get the discharge order , and until then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for the trustee .
If the trustee was informed of the shares and did nothing about it , you are more likely than not ok , but if the trustee was n't informed of the fact directly , then you may be in trouble .
If , however , your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court , then as a general matter the creditors can not go after the shares , unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them -LRB- e.g. , by putting his assets in the corporation 's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him -RRB- .
