A CNN poll asks readers to rate the president 's State of the Union speech last night .
After 90,000 votes Mr. Bush has a ` C-C + ' grade across the board , meaning 45,000 Republicans gave him an ` A ' and 45,000 liberals failed him .
But a new CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll suggests more people side with the president .
70 percent of respondents said Bush 's policies on health care were positive , while 66 percent approved of the president 's plan for Social Security .
78 percent said U.S. policy in Iraq is hading in the right direction , a 12 percentage point increase over pre-speech polling .
Overall , 77 percent of respondents said Bush is taking the country in the right direction after the speech compared to 67 percent beforehand .
And who was n't moved by the embrace of mother of a soldier killed in Iraq and the daughter of a man killed by Saddam Hussein 's regime ?
It was a beautiful moment last night that resulted in the longest standing ovation of the evening .
Today the parents of Marine Corps Sgt. Byron Norwood said the Iraqi woman , Safia Taleb al-Suhail , had turned and introduced herself just before the speech .
`` She thanked us for our son 's sacrifice and made sure we knew the people in Iraq were grateful for the sacrifices that were made not just by our son , but by all of them , '' Janet Norwood said .
It was an uplifting moment suggesting that maybe we 're doing the right thing .
I talked to a friend currently serving in Iraq last night and he says morale is up and the presence of troops is a positive thing .
They just ca n't pack up and leave .
Not just yet .
We must be patient .
