North Korea has Nuclear weapons .
The foreign minister of North Korea has state that North Korea has nuclear weapons and has officially with drawn from the 6 nation talks on Nuclear proliferation in east Asia .
The Foreign minister also indicated that North Korea will continue to develop long range missiles capable of obliterating any target within the borders of the United States .
According to East Asia Intelligence sources , North Korea has already prepositioned nuclear tipped missiles on Freighters and Fishing trawlers that are sailing under foreign flags of convenience , that are stationed off the west coast and East coast of the United States .
Missiles launched from these vessels are said to be able to hit 90 % percent of the major cities with in 2 and one half minutes from time of launch .
I do n't know about the rest of you but I think that in the next few weeks I will be moving supplies and equipment to my site in eastern Oregon .
Of course you can do what you want but I do n't trust the pot bellied idiot Kim Junk Ill any farther than I could throw him .

Re : North Korea has Nuclear weapons .
Well here is the problem that I face and many should be worried about .
If North Korea has had nuclear weapons for a few years then they developed them during the Clinton Administration .
The Clinton Administration also allowed Loral to sell Missile technology to China , who have been helping Pakistan to build their missiles .
That technology has undoubtably made it back to North Korea -LRB- Pakistan , Iran and North Korea are all working on the same set of missile blue prints -RRB- .
So now we have North Korea with nuclear weapons and workable missiles .
Also since we missed the boat on North Korea and Nuclear weapons how can we be sure that Iran does n't have nuclear weapons ?
The simple and wisest action is to assume that they do have a small number and are working feverishly to build a bigger arsenal .
Now the nut of the question should be , What if Iran gives , sells , provides nuclear weapons to Islamic extremists to smuggle into the United States and at 10 AM on a Wednesday pop 2 or 3 in New York City , destroying Wall street , the large banks , the large Insurance companies , the large sock brokerage houses and many other world wide financial institutions .
At the same time 2 weapons go off in Washington DC and take out the President , the Vice President , 80 Senators , and 350 congressmen as well as the department of the treasury , Interior , Health and Welfare , Justice , Commerce and the Federal Court system .
And then just for yucks lets assume that one goes off at the Pentagon .
Now what do we do ?
Remember all your pension funds are now gone .
all your investments are gone .
all the bank records are gone .
No more government payments for federal employees .
No more government payments for aid to schools , environment , police , courts , Well fare , etc. .
The Dollar is now worthless on the international market .
With a worthless dollar the amount of fuel available is not cut by 80 % .
No more cheap imports of clothes , boots , appliances , computer stuff , communications equipment , generators , electric motors Cars , Trucks etc. .
Massive unemployment as we are now in a service economy with nothing to service .
Does the word TEOTWAWKI have any meaning .
Oh I expect to things to hang together for a few weeks as local , county , and state governments try to hold things together , but they wo n't .
With out fuel to move food stuffs from the farms to food manufactures to local warehouses food stuffs will dry up with in a few week or so .
With out fuel to move imported stuff -LRB- most of what we buy these days -RRB- from the ports of entry to local warehouses and local retailer shelves of items like building materials , tools , and every thing else we buy the shelves will be empty in a month or so .
Of course the above does not take into account that people driven by fear do n't riot and loot every thing in site in the first week .
If the attack should happen in the winter , no Natural gas from Canada to heat homes , or fire steam driven electrical generators .
Of course we could convert back to coal but it will take a couple of weeks to convert them to coal but then how do you get the coal from the mines to the power plants ???
With no Social Security or pension payments , Aid to Dependent Children and other government payments , food stamps , -LRB- which are all checks and vouchers -RRB- , and there are no banks to cash them , -LRB- they got all wiped out in the New York financial destruction remember -RRB- no body will accept them .
No the situation does n't look good from where I sit .
Oh we can work on the assumption that the Mullahs of Iran will be rational , -LRB- but how rational are people who train and fund suicide bombers -RRB- and a rational Kim Junk Ill -LRB- who lets large numbers of his people starve to death every year so he can have nuclear weapons -RRB- kidnaps Japanese Citizens to teach English , Kidnaps movie stars so he can have private performances etc. .
Look at Kim Jung Ill behavior over the last decade or so any you will find that Hitler was a saint compared to Kim Junk Ill. .
No it 's going to be a scary time for the next decade or so and the neo-chamberlins -LRB- most of the leftist that most on this board -RRB- -LRB- you know prime minister chamberlin holding up his piece of paper containing an agreement from Herr Hitler with peace in our time -RRB- , are not going to do one thing to keep this country safe .
By the way I consider , Kerry , Dean , Kennedy , Carl Levin , Lathey , Murry , Finestien , Boxer , -LRB- Oh hell the whole Democratic party -RRB- and members of the press as neo-chamberlins .
Well on to a happier note .
I have a job interview today for a permanent position that will pay 20 % more than my contracting does and will have benefits .
Contracting here in Oregon is going at $ 14.00 an hour at Intell , up to $ 20 an hour at other places .
Why should Hi tech firms pay more in the United States than they do in China or India ?
Just heard yesterday that Hewlett Packard is shutting down its plant in Eugene , -LRB- Thank you very much MS. Fiorina -RRB- and SUN Micro systems is all but gone from Oregon .
Fortunately my interview is with a engineered to specification custom manufacturing facility .
