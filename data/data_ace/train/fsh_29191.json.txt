Ron
So uh what do you think about the uh topic of discussion this evening ?
Sherri
I 've been sort of surprised .
Eh uh I -- I heard uh that Colin Powell wanted um -- to resign last year and they talked him out of it .
Ron
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
Sherri
Or something like that and uh so -- I was still surprised this year when
Ron
Oh thi - you were surprised that he yo - that he decided to step down .
Sherri
yeah I I I still was uh -- kind of surprised .
Ron
Oh , huh , how interesting .
Sherri
eh -- And uh -- and then uh with Condoleezza Rice .
They 're appointing her ta - to a new position , and I was surprised about Ashcroft .
Ron
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
Sherri
I was n't like it and then Tom Ridge yesterday .
Ron
Yeah , I saw that .
Yeah , I I uh that one I think one probably was the one that most surprised me .
I had n't I had n't really thought about it .
I -- Colin Powell did n't surprise me .
Ashcroft surprised me a little bit um but um I sort of started to think he might step down because evidently he was being he was considered somewhat of a lightning rod for um you know some of his more controversial stands and stuff so .
Sherri
Uh-huh .
Ron
But and and so have you been following the uh the proposed nominees ?
I mean do you think
Sherri
Kellogg , the Kellogg guy .
Ron
Oh yeah , that 's right .
Where 's he going to Commerce ?
Is that where he 's headed ?
Sherri
Yeah , that 's it , huh ?
Ron
Yeah , I do n't know anything about him .
I I do n't know .
Do you know anything about him ?
Sherri
Mm .
Well , all I know is that that 's like a real prestigious uh position , you know to be the what the ~ CEO of Kellogg ?
Ron
Yeah , yeah .
I guess it sort of concerns me that uh you know we 're looking at yet uh another corporate head coming into the government .
I
Sherri
Mm .
Ye - ye - you know , this is like a -- uh it 's a re - -- I think we have a real problem .
That is uh -- you know almost like a big beast you know that 's right there and we do n't even identify it
Ron
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
Sherri
way way way more than we realize .
Ron
Yeah , I I think you 're probably right and I think it -- maybe even particularly true under this President , although I do n't think it 's just limited to him .
I think it 's a common problem in the ~ US .
Sherri
I f - -- I uh I think i - i - it 's uh more evident now than ever .
Ron
Uh-huh , uh-huh
Sherri
You know , really um -- tremen - tremendously a ruling and reigning .
Ron
Did you um
Sherri
I think it it 's a global uh has a global effect .
Ron
Yeah .
Sherri
I think that 's why Al-Qaeda -- took down the the uh twin towers .
Eh w - they were making a a statement .
Uh I think something like that possibly , that it had to do with corporate America .
Ron
Uh-huh , you mean about the corporate thing ?
Sherri
Hm ?
Ron
Uh you mean because of its -- what it represented around corporate America or something ?
Is that what you think .
Sherri
I think what corporate America represents -- you know the the financial scheme of it all , the
Ron
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
Sherri
the it just how it eff - effects the globe ,
Ron
Mhm .
Sherri
and how eh it effects third world countries and you know just the whole thing .
It 's just
Ron
Mhm , mhm .
Uh-huh .
Sherri
it 's a you know like a a a wealthy despotism or something like that .
Ron
So any thoughts on who you uh you would name ?
Sherri
-LRB- -LRB- -RRB- -RRB- -- You know who I would name ?
I know this is really wild .
Ron
Do you suppose ?
Uh-huh .
Sherri
But uh I do n't know you 'll probably really laugh but I do n't know , I I I always thought that -- Ralph Nader was kind of a a character
Ron
Oh .
Uh-huh .
Sherri
but what I really I mean I really listened to what he said when he was being interviewed
Ron
Mhm .
Sherri
and in just a few words , he did n't mince any meat or anything , in a few words he said so much that was so
Ron
Uh-huh .
Sherri
like -- like a clarion call it rang so clear .
You could hear what he was saying and it was really making sense , and I think he 's an expert
Ron
So who would y - what would you appoint him to ?
Sherri
on
Ron
Any particular position ?
I mean , I think that 's a good idea .
Sherri
eh -- there 's something to do with the economy y - you know for the with the to deal with the
Ron
Yeah .
Sherri
just uh -- like a an equa - e - economic equilibrium or something .
Ron
He might be be good at -- yeah , he might be good at commerce instead of that Kellogg 's guy .
