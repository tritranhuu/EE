Jennifer Tilly was born Jennifer Chan .
Why is this so ????
I was researching Meg Tilly on the internet and thus accidentally found out that Jennifer Tilly was born Jennifer Chan .
This is documented in a few web sites .
I used to wonder if Meg Tilly was part chinese because of her eyes , so now I wonder more .
Well , are they ??????????
How tall is Meg Tilly ?
I ca n't find any web sites that state how tall she is !!!!

One bit of trivia that has been asked a LOT concerns Meg 's ` ethnicity ' .
Well , for the longest time this was a topic she and her sister Jennifer seemed to avoid , but a few months back , Jennifer announced to the world that their father is Chinese .
So , that should answer all of THOSE questions .
Personally it has never made much difference to me - she is who and what she is !
Oh .
.
!
And for all of you who have been asking how TALL she is - an article about Meg in the January 1984 issue of ` Seventeen ' magazine states she is 5 ft 6 inches .

Oh my goodness ... I never even realized there were two of them till now !
The Tilly actress I * knew * just had this way of sometimes looking really good , sometimes like a bloated alcoholic sexpot who 'd spent way too much time on the barstool .
Mystery solved !

Well , Jennifer is certainly far sexier than Meg .
Meg is sorta like the female Steve Buschemi .
Homely , but a good actor and well respected .
Jennifer is still smokin ' hot at 46 .
