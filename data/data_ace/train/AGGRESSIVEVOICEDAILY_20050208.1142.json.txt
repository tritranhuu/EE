In a recent blog post Michelle Malkin mentions the `` abortion jewelry '' marketed by the lovely feminist of `` Unf * cked P * ssy , '' Joanna Rytel .
Not that I was surprised - considering not long ago we were introduced to a people who proudly donned the `` I had an abortion '' slogan with great pride on their t-shirts .
The first trackback entry is from the typical anti-Christian variety :
Ms. Rytel is absolutely correct , the anti-abortion Christians have managed to convice -LRB- sic -RRB- nearly everyone that abortion is wrong and people should feel horribly guilty over it .
Like we have n't heard this rant before .
Yes , only the Christians value life when it 's a life before birth .
Of course it would be wrong to make people feel `` horribly guilty '' over abortion , but celebrating the skull-cracking procedure `` for the sake of the child '' in the form of t-shirts and jewelry is to be admired .
The problem for the pro-abortion movement is that hardly anyone is taking a stand to reverse this societal brainwashing .
Even by calling the movement `` pro-choice '' instead of `` pro-abortion , '' it gives credence to the Christian loonies .
Here is where I agree with my fellow Libertarian .
`` Pro-choice '' is a soft and weak label for what those people really truly represent .
I prefer pro-murder , anti-life or anti-responsibility as a suitable replacement .
