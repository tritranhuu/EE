Death of Arafat -LRB- 2 -RRB- PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week , after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death .
What do you think caused his illness , and could it have been something malicious -LRB- like poisoning -RRB- ?
What do you think of Israel 's policies surrounding Arafat 's illness and death ?
Should President Bush or a senior US official have attended Arafat 's funeral ?
Should Israel have let Arafat be buried in Jerusalem ?
Paul
Hi , I 'm Paul .
I 'm in Delaware .
Mike
Hi , this is Mike .
I 'm in California .
Paul
Nice to meet you , Mike .
Mike
Yeah , nice to meet you .
Paul
Uh , well , pretty complicated -- topic .
Mike
Yeah , interesting issue .
I do n't know .
What do you think ?
You think it was poison ?
Paul
Well -- -LRB- -LRB- smoosh -RRB- -RRB- no , I I heard that just a couple of days ago and -- I I kind of doubt it or at least I hope not .
I guess that 's what it is .
Mike
Yeah , I do n't think he was poisoned .
I think he was just fr - frail and I think he 'd been uh , he 'd been looking frail and he was shaky .
Paul
Yeah .
Mike
You know , he 'd been looking h - like he was shaking and , uh , seeming frail .
For some time when I 'd see him in public , uh ,
Paul
Yeah , that 's true .
Mike
presentation -- so forth .
Paul
Right .
Mike
And I think it whatever it was , it got him , just caught up with him and and he reached the you know , the end of his time .
Paul
Yeah .
Mike
So , that 's about it on that , I guess .
Paul
Yeah .
Well , I I guess now that that he 's he 's died -- it 'll be , uh , or it it should be a change for the ~ PLO
Mike
Well , yeah , it 'll be change .
I I do n't know if it 'll move forward any better -- but , uh , this , uh , I 've heard our administration thinks it will .
I think he was a block to the peace -- but I think it 's not only his doing , it 's also the -- you know , the , uh , more , uh , drastic elements of the ~ PLO that , uh , that , uh , would n't allow him to pursue peace
Paul
Right .
Mike
at any cost .
Paul
Well , I 'm -- I 'm -- I do n't know , uh .
He he seems like a guy who is much more comfortable -- being under siege than in negotiating peace settlements .
Mike
Uh-huh .
Paul
Um , I
Mike
Yeah .
Paul
maybe that
Mike
Well , you know , he was kind of damned if he did and damned if he did n't .
Paul
Yeah .
Well
Mike
You know , if he if he made peace he had factions of his own people that would 've killed him -- and if he did n't make peace , eh , then he 's considered , you know , the the warmongering , uh , man who wo n't make peace , you know .
So , he , uh , he could n't really win .
I do n't think he could make peace .
I do n't know if anyone else can , either .
Paul
Yeah , I guess that 's the big question , if someone moderate takes over and they reach a settlement , does that mean the ~ PLO will split ?
I mean that -- that could be just -- dangerous .
Mike
Yeah .
Paul
I guess , uh , making peace with half of the Palestinians is better than nothing .
Mike
One of the other questions it asked us was , did we think our president and our , uh , you know , officials should 've attended his funeral .
Paul
-LRB- -LRB- Oh , I b - -RRB- -RRB-
Mike
What do you think about that ?
Paul
Yeah .
Well , I I do n't remember who they sent , but they did send over some very -- low level state department person
Mike
Oh , I see .
Paul
and , uh ,
Mike
I did n't know that .
Paul
I I -- I was kind of embarrassed about that .
Mike
That we did or d - that we did not send our officials .
Paul
I mean -- We -- we did , but i - it was some -- it was a nobody , basically .
Mike
So you were embarrassed because you thought they should 've sent someone higher up ?
Paul
Yeah .
Mike
Oh , I see .
Paul
I I -- I mean , for for the funeral ceremony in , uh , Egypt .
-LRB- -LRB- I mean -RRB- -RRB-
Mike
Yeah , I think so , too .
I think they should 've sent someone higher up .
Paul
And , uh , I I can understand that they would n't want to send anybody
Mike
-LRB- -LRB- that he -RRB- -RRB- -- Do n't forget this was the this was the representative of a whole people , you know what I mean ?
Paul
Yeah .
Mike
The past he was their main representative and , uh , just out of respect for the people we should 've sent someone I think .
Paul
Hm .
Bad bad or good .
Yeah , I think it would 've been a much more positive message .
Mike
Yeah .
Paul
-LRB- -LRB- We realized that -RRB- -RRB-
Mike
I think it would 've , uh , you know , been a -- a step toward , um , you know , gaining the , uh , I do n't know , the respect and and the , um ,
Paul
Right .
Yeah , I think that
Mike
uh , th - of the people that we 're going to have to be working with to try to bring about a peace , you know .
Paul
that -LRB- -LRB- yeah , -RRB- -RRB- it -- Yeah .
Mike
And , uh , it would 've -- gone an - a little farther to encourage them to , you know , be willing to sit down at the table with us , at least , you know .
Paul
That 's true .
Mike
And , I mean not that it would 've even been noticed -- in that regard had he -- had had our president or someone higher gone , but the fact that they did n't , that 's what 's really going to be noticed , you know what I mean ?
Paul
Yeah .
Well , uh , you know , Colin Powell is a -- pretty moderate guy and would 've been nice to see him there or maybe -- the , uh , Deputy -- Secret of State .
Mike
Uh-huh .
Paul
I 'm not even sure who that is .
Eh , somebody will -- or higher up .
Mike
Yeah , someone m - a little more , uh
Paul
Some flunky bureaucrat .
Mike
yeah .
Yeah , it did n't seem quite appropriate .
Paul
But , uh , at at least for the ceremony in Egypt I think , uh , I can understand that no one would want to go into -- Palestinian territory .
I mean , they it was total chaos there .
Mike
Uh-huh .
Sure .
Yeah .
