The `` Twin Deficits '' Myth

According to the usually reliable CNN/Money , the `` Twin Deficits '' will continue to grow .
Interesting terminology ... I believe they 're referring to the budget deficit and ... the capital surplus ?
When analyzing trade deficits , it 's important to realize that the amount by which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign investors have bet on the US .
So the trade deficit is due to a confluence of the pressures from US consumers -LRB- who control about 20 % of global GDP -RRB- and everybody else -LRB- excluding the non-consumption share of US GDP , that would amount to around 75 % of global GDP -RRB- .
Which of those is -- probably -- going to be a more important number ?
Even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with imported goods , the largest pressure on the deficit is that we 're simply a better place for investment -- higher returns on capital in developing countries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks they face .
And what about that other deficit ?
It , of course , is the ominous sum that we fund without taxes , but by borrowing funds .
And about half of those borrowings end up with the major banks in Asia .
So , not to be a heretic , but 1 -RRB- We 're issuing them at relatively low interest rates , 2 -RRB- Inflation is bound to pick up eventually , and so 3 -RRB- Would n't you rather have our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases by non-US investors , rather than raising taxes in America ?
It 's a question of who will pay for the same spending , and all else being equal I 'd be happy for Asian central banks to pick up the tab .
The Twin Deficits are a reality , but they are n't exactly a terrifying one .
