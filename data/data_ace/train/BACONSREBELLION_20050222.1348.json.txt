A Pitiful , Helpless Giant

Anyone who has spent any time in NVA over the last 40 years is familiar with the Giant grocery store chain .
When the chain passed from its private owners a few years ago , problems began .
These problems multiplied when the New England chain Stop n ' Shop acquired Giant .
Add new competition -- Food Lion , Harris Teeter , and Wegman 's -- and loyalty to Giant , once an article of faith , is dissipating .
It 's a cautionary tale for business and for any long-standing organization seeking to change .
Michael Barbaro has an article on Giant 's recent problems in the Washington Post , plus he took questions online today .
One interesting note : most of the online negative comments about Giant come from Maryland residents .
Most of the new stores competing with Giant are in Virginia .

I 'm new to this area -LRB- 1 year -RRB- so I ca n't really comment on Giant .
Seems like an ok store ... I prefer Harris Teeter .
Now Ukrops !
That 's a well run enterprise .

I worked there as a youngster many years back .
Bagged groceries .
And I remember one day they had a dozen japanese businessmen touring the place trying to figure out how they did it ...
