Holocaust Day
Yet again I notice that the media see gays as ` invisible ' when it comes to Holocaust Day .
This morning , when talking about the horrors of Auswitch on the BBC Breakfast programme , they referred to the slaughter of thousands of Jews and others .
Surely gays and gypsies warrant more than to be referred to as ` others ' .
You would n't know anything about the slaughter of gays if you only listened to the BBC .

I have just -LRB- in the last 1/2 hour -RRB- heard Radio Wales refer to the millions of Jews and other minorites including Gypsies and homosexuals who died in the concentration camps .

Re : Holocaust Day
The ` others ' were named on Radio 4 's Today .
Seems that those who listen to the BBC know , but those who watch it do not :p

Re : Holocaust Day
Hello Thomas ,
As mentioned in `` The Final Solution '' thread , the number of men killed for being homosexual was at the most 10-15 ,000 .
Now that 's significant , but compared to the genocide of Jews and Zigeuner it 's not as significant -LRB- though of course to the family and loved ones of those who died every single one is significant -RRB- .
Not trying to deny it happened , just trying to see some perspective .
I for one said Kaddish this morning and will do so again at dusk .

Re : Holocaust Day
I was watching the BBC news this morning and they interviewed the man who is going to be in charge of Holocaust Day , certainly in the future .
He very specifically mentioned gays , along with blacks and roma , and said that he was going to try and link future Days to the dangers of current prejudice and oppression .

Re : Holocaust Day
This is a bit like rating Stalin and Hitler for badness purely on the grounds of the number of deaths they were responsible for .
It 's `` significant '' if any group of people is identified for liquidation by the government of the country in which they live , surely ?
If there are n't as many identifiable individuals from a particular group in the general population , then by your significance = headcount yardstick some groups are never ever going to get rated as `` significant '' .
In some ways , it is amazing that the Nazis were able to identify even * two * thousand homosexuals in the Thirties .
By a bitter irony , without the burgeoning gay liberation movement in Germany -LRB- Magnus Hirschfeld et al -RRB- the issue may not even have arisen .

Re : Holocaust Day
That 's good .
I did get an email back from the BBC saying that they understood what I was saying and would try to be more inclusive .

Re : Holocaust Day
Hello John ,
I 'm simply trying to get some perspective .
The Holocaust of the Jews and Zigeuner was motivated by racial prejudices .
The murder of -LRB- at the most -RRB- 10k homosexuals was n't .
Most homosexuals arrested during the Nazi era were imprisoned in normal jails .
If you were homosexually oriented but did nothing with it the law in 30s Germany could n't touch you .
The Jews and Zigeuner on the other hand were killed simply for their ontological state .
Once again , I 'm not diminishing the horror of any individual murder , just trying to get it into perspective .

Re : Holocaust Day
Hang on a moment up there you say
it 's shrunk , I think your agenda is showing !
And that previous quote says
a rather important qualification .
I think the chance of their being only 10000 who were homosexual amongst the how ever million were killed in the camps is rather small .
Records appear to show that 50000 _ men _ were convicted of homosexuality during the Nazi rule , finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jails were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence , but 10-15k seems reasonable
