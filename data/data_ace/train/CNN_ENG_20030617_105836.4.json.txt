i think these are profitable childrens book .
so very popular .
i think that people think they probably are lucrative for them .
as you mentioned , if anyone is seen to be selling these on the black market they will be prosecuted .
is that why you think they were stolen , sale before the deadline or after ?

but i know no reputable book shop will take these stolen goods and sell them .
i think we are looking at in market stores and sales over the next coming days .
we have police officers looking for them and will prosecute anyone seen selling them or buying them .
considering how much publicity was circulating about this book , there is injunctions about publishing anything or talking about the plot .
