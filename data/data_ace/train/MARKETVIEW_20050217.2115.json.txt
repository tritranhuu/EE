An Airline Passenger 's Bill of Rights ?

Has the EU once again lost its mind ?
The one industry in which Europe incontrovertibly beats the US is their aviation industry , thanks mainly to the fact that their lawmakers have left the operation of the industry up to the people who own it , and left passenger 's rights in the hands of choosy passengers .
And now they 're ready to ` fix ' that with a new package of ill-advised rules completely changing the nature of airlines .
Before , a potential customer could choose between a cosy , near-certain ride from an expensive company or a hustled , uncomfortable , and absurdly cheap one from a smaller competitor .
And now ?
Not a chance .
