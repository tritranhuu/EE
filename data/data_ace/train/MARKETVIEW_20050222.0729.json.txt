Read this report on the U.S.-Russia Technology Symposium .
It 's a great summary of the paradoxes of the Russian economy : They have a huge untapped supply of valuable IT labor , but their IT exports are only a tenth of their military exports -LRB- and only a thirtieth of India 's IT exports -RRB- .
They develop lots of new technology , but nobody can tell who owns what .
And , of course , their securities laws and property rights are even flimsier than China 's -- after the Putin administration mugged Yukos on the grounds that it was too attractive a target to leave alone , they lost a lot of trust .
Still , they have an unbelieveable amount of untapped potential .
