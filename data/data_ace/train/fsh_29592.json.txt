Death of Arafat -LRB- 2 -RRB- PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week , after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death .
What do you think caused his illness , and could it have been something malicious -LRB- like poisoning -RRB- ?
What do you think of Israel 's policies surrounding Arafat 's illness and death ?
Should President Bush or a senior US official have attended Arafat 's funeral ?
Should Israel have let Arafat be buried in Jerusalem ?
Marco
Hello , th - I 'm Marco from Illinois .
Mike
Hi , I 'm Mike from New Jersey .
Marco
New Jersey .
How are you doing , Mike ?
Mike
Pretty good .
How 's it going ?
Marco
Pretty good .
Pretty good .
Mike
So - so what do you think ?
Marco
Well , I 'm think -
Mike
How about you start .
Marco
Yeah , okay , um , -LRB- -LRB- lot of question -RRB- -RRB- -- and , um , I - I do n't think it was poisoning , even though I have n't read -- a lot of articles about it .
I think -
Mike
He - he was old .
I mean -
Marco
Y - he was old , yeah .
And - -- and that - I - I did n't realize he was n't allowed to be buried in Jerusalem , which -
Mike
Yeah , but a lot of that has to do with things that he 's done .
Marco
Yeah .
Mike
He 's - I mean , like , you know , let 's - i - -- for - for all he did in his later years , eh , Yasser Arafat was responsible for -- a good chunk of al - you know , a lot of -- Israeli dying -- i - you know .
He basically , eh , i - I 'm completely torn on the whole thing .
I mean , on one hand -- I think it was kind of wrong that -- that -- you know , the ~ UN just kind of went in and said , hey , you know , guess what ?
You know , we 're - we 're you know , this is Israel now , state of Israel .
And basically what they did was they carved up the region and - -- without any regard to , you know , tribal -- animosity really , is really what it boils down to ,
Marco
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Mike
um .
You know , then it th - it was there , he had to try to maintain the status quo -- but they bred -- people like Yasser Arafat , I mean , if it -- if it was n't for the stupidity of the United Nations , people like Yasser Yara - Arafat w - probably would 've never even gotten off the ground , you know .
Marco
How how did the United Nations , uh , Arafat in power , or help ?
Mike
Well , in other words eh , in other -- when -- after World War Two when they when -- basically the state of Israel was formed
Marco
Mhm .
Mike
in f - uh , nineteen forty eight , I think it was .
Marco
Yeah .
Mike
Um , you know , you - e - -- granted , you know , there were there were Jewish people already living there , but -- all the Jewish people started going there and they j - basically just - you know , they just took over .
And - and
Marco
Yeah .
Mike
in in a region where , uh , you know , y - you know , we live in America .
It 's like coup - you know , f - our country 's a couple hundred years old , we got a couple of gripes going back to , you know , what , seventeen seventy six ,
Marco
Yeah .
Mike
there it goes , you know , thous - it 's like the Hatfields and the McCoys .
They 're fi - they do n't even know why they 're fighting anymore .
They just they hate each other -- and they 're always going to hate each other -- and it does n't matter who started it , but -- i - you know , somebody eh , th - somebody 's in always intent on winning .
And it 's and it 's it 's you know , a war of attrition .
Nobody wins .
It 's either , you know , you may kill me , but I 'm going to kill all of you before - y - you know what I mean ?
It 's just i - i - it 's stupid .
The whole thing 's stupid .
And a guy like Yasser Arafat ,
Marco
Yeah .
Yeah .
Mike
he was a terrorist .
In in the sixties -- in the mid sixties an - and and a - you know , on into - -- you know , through the mid eighties -- the guy was a terrorist .
Marco
So , let us let us not forget that when Israel was -- formed -- and they were , um , the -- the Israelis for not feeling -- like they had a legitimate -- right -- some of the land or that -- land was n't , um , rightfully theirs .
There were -- two very strong -- militant groups that were Israeli and they -- committed a lot of terrorist acts ,
Mike
Oh , the yeah , the Zionists .
Abso - absolutely .
Marco
much -- Yeah .
So , I mean , i - -- you know , uh , how we consider -- Arafat a terrorist , we also should consider that -- could 've been , in some ways , a reaction to some of the terrorism that was -- initially -- committed by the Israelis .
Mike
Absolutely .
I 'm not believe me , I 'm not I 'm not excusing -- anybody -- but for the purpose I I mean , the way I see it is you know , I guess for the purposes of the conversation th - -- that they want to hear ,
Marco
Yeah .
Mike
y - you got to kind of have to put that as y - -- i - it 's kind of like -- do if that 's the case , do two wrongs really make a right ?
You know what I mean ?
Marco
But if Arafat had n't been I do n't know if he 's -- directly -- been linked to Hamas ' acts , uh , but he was put in a -- pretty -- sticky situation having to negotiate -- the militants of -- Palestine -- the international leaders -- and if it if Hara - Arafat had n't -- somehow appeased -- the Hamas groups or the Palestinian militants , then -- he would 've been kicked out , overthrown -- by - -- by the Palestinians .
Mike
Oh , forget about kicked out or overthrown , he would 've been killed .
That 's - that 's how it works over there .
Marco
Yeah .
Yeah .
Exactly .
Well , it it 's not really Arafat -- as an individual , I think it 's just -- whatever leader -- is -- placed in the position of -
Mike
He was he was basically -- I mean , I 've read I 've read articles an - and - and - and -- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the Munich -- massacre -- th - you know , the Munich Olympic massacre th - the Is - the Israeli team .
It - -- the the problem is -- what he did -- back way back when
Marco
Uh-huh .
Mike
will -- f - forever tarnish anything that he did -- in his later years .
Like like you said , bringing the groups together but the reason that he was able to bring them together is because he was once one of them .
