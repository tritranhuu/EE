Criminal Trials/Peterson Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son , and he now faces the death penalty .
There 's been a lot of media coverage of the Peterson trial .
Why do you think this trial has been so publicized ?
What other criminal trials have gotten a lot of media attention , and why ?
What 's the most memorable criminal trial you can recall ?
Winnette
Hi , this is Winnette , in Michigan .
Irvin
Hi this is Irvin , Sullivan , Illinois .
What 's your name again ?
Winnette
Winnette .
With a ~ W.
Irvin
~ WYNETT ?
Winnette
~ INNETTE .
Irvin
~ WI -- Okay .
Okay .
You 're in Michigan , huh ?
Winnette
Yeah ?
Irvin
All right .
Uh , what do you know about this Scott -- Peterson trial ?
I do n't know much about it , to be honest with you .
Winnette
Oh this is funny because I just , one of my calls the other day was regarding this .
Irvin
Really ?
Winnette
So uh uh they 're act - -- actually that 's getting a few different questions and -- actually the gentleman I got the other day -- had n't even heard about it .
Um ,
Irvin
Oh really ?
Winnette
Well um , I 've been following it pretty closely .
Um , I guess because of -- you know it being a mother and -- being pregnant for a baby .
Irvin
Oh , uh-huh .
Winnette
Um , kind of hit more to -- I you know to home .
Um , So you -- how much of it have you followed ?
Did , did you -- follow any of it at all when it was on in the news or in the papers or anything ?
Irvin
Hardly any of it at all , because -- um -- for one thing -- I do not have a ~ TV or a radio and I do n't get a daily newspaper .
We get
Winnette
Oh wow .
Irvin
we get a weekly newspaper .
Winnette
Okay .
Um , well I 'll I do n't get any newspapers at the house , but -- I listen to the radio every morning on my way to work and
Irvin
Oh yeah ?
Winnette
and uh -- when it first happened it was -- pretty publicized on every radio station um -- it come across -- on the news and we keep our ~ TV on at my work , because we have a customer waiting area , so
Irvin
Oh , uh-huh .
Winnette
um actually one of our employees had wa - watched -LRB- -LRB- happening -RRB- -RRB- -- so from that point on we kind of -- talked a lot about it at work and
Irvin
How long ago was it ?
Winnette
different things .
Um , it was a year -- almost a year ago .
Over a year ago ?
Because it was just before Christmas -- that it happened .
Irvin
Over a year ago .
Winnette
Yeah .
Um , I 'm thinking -- I do n't know , November , December , I 'm not sure exactly .
But I know it was just before Christmas -- when they had uh -- it had happened , because she was missing during Christmas and then they had found her body .
And they -- they found the baby as well .
Irvin
Terrible .
Winnette
Um , so when they found the baby , the baby of course had been -- they do n't know if the baby was born , through delivery , or -- if maybe from um -- the corpse I guess
Irvin
So the baby was separate .
Winnette
maybe extracted it .
Um , actually she was pregnant for the baby .
Irvin
But the baby was separate from the body when he found it ?
Winnette
Yes .
Yep .
Um , I do n't know if ma - I you know I do n't know the whole story for sure , but -- um -- he had -- you know , obviously -- denied that he was involved anything to do with it .
Then they found out that he was having an affair on her .
And -- then of course when they were investigating him -- he tried running .
Dyed his hair and -- grew out a mustache and -- they caught him trying to run with -- quite a bit of cash .
Irvin
Wow .
Winnette
So I mean ,
Irvin
-LRB- -LRB- -RRB- -RRB-
Winnette
he 's -- in all honesty been guilty all along the way but
Irvin
Uh-huh .
Winnette
of course you know they 've got to give him that reasonable doubt .
Irvin
Uh-huh .
So is he is he still um -- in prison now ?
Winnette
Yeah .
And they 're making the determination if -- in fact he will get the death penalty , or life in prison .
So that 's what 's is up in the air right now .
Irvin
What state is this in ?
Winnette
California .
Irvin
It 's in California .
Winnette
And -- um -- I know I had , it was supposed to have be deliberated on -- the twenty-second of November , but they had an issue happen with -- one of the jurors -- so it 's postponed everything .
But , actually they were trying to pass a law , and I do n't know if it ever did take into effect , that if in fact a mother was killed , and pregnant , um -- for there to be a double murder charge .
Irvin
Oh , uh-huh .
Winnette
And -- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that charge if they were -- found guilty on both charges .
Irvin
Uh-huh .
Winnette
And -- so it 's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby .
So he did n't get both first degree murders .
Irvin
What 's the difference ?
Winnette
Where -- Um , I guess because he did n't murder the baby directly .
Irvin
Oh .
Winnette
I 'm thinking maybe was the difference .
And because of the the charge on the baby , they could n't automatically give him the death penalty , but -- obviously there 's enough -- um , complaints or whatever
Irvin
What was his excuse for doing something horrible like that ?
Winnette
and -- well he still denies everything .
He has never admitted
Irvin
-LRB- -LRB- Still does -RRB- -RRB-
Winnette
to do it .
um -- But the only thing they can figure is that maybe -- he wanted back into the bachelor life , and did n't want to be a father , did n't want to be tied down with a wife and child
Irvin
So he did n't have any other children ?
Winnette
that was -- No , that was going to be their first .
And actually I do n't even think they were married that long , maybe a year or two .
